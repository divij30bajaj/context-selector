Unfortunately , at the same time as we &apos;re discovering this treasure trove of potentially habitable worlds , our own planet is sagging under the weight of humanity .







Together , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky , like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System , and also how much light they receive from their parent sun . Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System . In turn , this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not .

Mars is small and rocky , and though it &apos;s a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler . These planetary-scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly outpacing our ability to alter their course .
Now , as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe , I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth , the more you appreciate our own planet itself . Mars is small and rocky , and though it &apos;s a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler . Each one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Solar System .




Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere , trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability . Our rovers , like Curiosity , crawl across its surface , scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it . You could say that I look for choice alien real estate .


Mars is small and rocky , and though it &apos;s a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler .

Even in the driest , highest places on Earth , the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests .

There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars , but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats .
I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long , dark shadow : the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of , the Earth . Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet , places that are lush by comparison with Mars .



As much as I love interplanetary exploration , I deeply disagree with this idea . But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another . If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile , inhospitable spaces here on Earth , perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it .
Many years ago , the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that , given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it , we should have found evidence for alien life by now . As much as I love interplanetary exploration , I deeply disagree with this idea .













And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys . In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the dining room table where I had left them . A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
I had just driven home , it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter , I had been visiting my friend , Jeff , across town , and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees -- and don &apos;t bother asking if that &apos;s Celsius or Fahrenheit , minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold . So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .



So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it . This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith , so I figured , under the circumstances , I was coming out even . I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Jeff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase .
And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ? So I raced home in the snow and ice , 40 minutes , got my passport , raced back to the airport , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the bathrooms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t recline , on an eight-hour flight . Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
So , desperate and freezing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window , cleared out the shards of glass , I crawled through , I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening , figuring that in the morning , on the way to the airport , I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it .



So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t crystallize until about a month later . So the next morning , when I woke up on too little sleep , worrying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contractor , and the freezing temperatures , and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cortisol in my brain , my thinking was cloudy , but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy . And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the airport check-in counter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my passport .
And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?

Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage . It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-mortem . And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem . Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage . Now , you all know what the postmortem is .


I was having dinner with my colleague , Danny Kahneman , the Nobel Prize winner , and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , forgotten my passport , and Danny shared with me that he &apos;d been practicing something called prospective hindsight .
Well , in the pre-mortem , Danny explained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minimize the damage . It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-mortem . Now , you all know what the postmortem is .

Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious . So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem . Whenever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things -- where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live . So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hippocampus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the locations of important things -- where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friendly and enemy tribes live . They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things . The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged .
Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .

And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels , and they could still find their nuts . They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things . Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts . They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things . Around the home , designate a place for things that are easily lost .



If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them . But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
For your reading glasses , a particular table .
For your passport , a particular drawer . If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them . They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hippocampus , this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things .
So in the home , designate a spot for your keys -- a hook by the door , maybe a decorative bowl . For your reading glasses , a particular table . For your passport , a particular drawer .


So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .

Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s license , your passport , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud . If you designate a spot and you &apos;re scrupulous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them . If these things are lost or stolen , you can facilitate replacement .


So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . &quot; And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition . But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , and social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts .
And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .

And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make .
And there &apos;s perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you &apos;re confronted with a medical decision to make . And you &apos;ve probably heard of statins , you know that they &apos;re among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today , you probably even know people who take them . And so you &apos;re thinking having high cholesterol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doctor says , &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol , a statin . &quot;






It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped . And so you &apos;re thinking having high cholesterol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doctor says , &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol , a statin . &quot; My doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .

My doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it &apos;s not going to help . It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .


It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure before one person is helped . And it &apos;s not the doctor &apos;s fault , if it &apos;s anybody &apos;s fault , it &apos;s the fault of scientists like me . My doctor wouldn &apos;t prescribe something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .



How many people have to take it before one person is helped ? But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people . But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , stroke or other adverse event is prevented . So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin , what do you suppose it is ? Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol .



How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?



But you should ask at this point for another statistic , and that is , &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; Right ? 300 people take the drug , right ? One person &apos;s helped , five percent of those 300 have side effects , that &apos;s 15 people . So think about how you &apos;re going to work through this ahead of time , so you don &apos;t have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot .
Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol . So for this particular drug , the side effects occur in five percent of the patients . But you should ask at this point for another statistic , and that is , &quot; Tell me about the side effects . &quot; Right ?

Why not , doc ? Give me the prescription anyway . &quot;

You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .



For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 . And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients . 300 people take the drug , right ? One person &apos;s helped , five percent of those 300 have side effects , that &apos;s 15 people .

For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50 , removal of the prostate for cancer , the number needed to treat is 49 . They include impotence , erectile dysfunction , urinary incontinence , rectal tearing , fecal incontinence . And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients .
Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pulled this number out of the air for shock value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .




You might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you &apos;re practiced with this kind of thinking . And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients . And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .




These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones . You might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you &apos;re practiced with this kind of thinking .
Face-to-face with a predator , you don &apos;t need your digestive system , or your libido , or your immune system , because if you &apos;re body is expending metabolism on those things and you don &apos;t react quickly , you might become the lion &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter . Remember , our brain under stress releases cortisol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down . I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed .


The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be , to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place . Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I got back from my trip , I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .
We all are going to fail now and then . Unfortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown .




And I have to admit , I still have piles of mail that haven &apos;t been sorted , and piles of emails that I haven &apos;t gone through . Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal , when I got back from my trip , I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combination .

Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict , because war has changed .
My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation . For the past decade , I &apos;ve been studying non-state armed groups : armed organizations like terrorists , insurgents or militias .


It is now a conflict between states and non-state actors . It used to be a contest between states . No longer . For the past decade , I &apos;ve been studying non-state armed groups : armed organizations like terrorists , insurgents or militias .

It used to be a contest between states . No longer . Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict , because war has changed . We need to know what makes these organizations tick .

Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict , because war has changed . We need to know what makes these organizations tick .


We cannot understand these groups , let alone defeat them , if we don &apos;t have the full picture . So we need to understand these groups ; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful . And armed groups today are complex organizations .
It is all part of the same organization . But since its creation in the early 1980s , Hezbollah has also set up a political party , a social-service network , and a military apparatus . We know a lot about how they fight , why they fight , but no one looks at what they &apos;re doing when they &apos;re not fighting .

Similarly , the Palestinian Hamas , known for its suicide attacks against Israel , also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007 . Take the Lebanese Hezbollah , known for its violent confrontation against Israel . And armed groups today are complex organizations .
Yet , armed struggle and unarmed politics are related . They multi-task . We know a lot about how they fight , why they fight , but no one looks at what they &apos;re doing when they &apos;re not fighting .
And armed groups today are complex organizations . Yet , armed struggle and unarmed politics are related . We know a lot about how they fight , why they fight , but no one looks at what they &apos;re doing when they &apos;re not fighting .

Take the Lebanese Hezbollah , known for its violent confrontation against Israel .
And armed groups today are complex organizations . And up here , you have the ISIS magazine , printed in English and published to recruit .

Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising -- not looting , but setting up profitable businesses ; for example , construction companies . They multi-task . Now , these activities are keys .

Armed groups also do something else : they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services . Now , these activities are keys . Similarly , the Palestinian Hamas , known for its suicide attacks against Israel , also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007 .

Now , these activities are keys . And up here , you have the ISIS magazine , printed in English and published to recruit . Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising -- not looting , but setting up profitable businesses ; for example , construction companies .

But in general , providing social services fills a gap , a governance gap left by the government , and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power . The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan , or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS , can be understood also by looking at these groups &apos; efforts to provide security . Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising -- not looting , but setting up profitable businesses ; for example , construction companies .

Armed groups also do something else : they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services . They allow these groups to increase their strength , increase their funds , to better recruit and to build their brand . They build schools , they run hospitals , they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs .
Now , unfortunately , in these cases , the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population . Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing : safety and security . But in general , providing social services fills a gap , a governance gap left by the government , and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power .

For example , the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group &apos;s social work .
But in general , providing social services fills a gap , a governance gap left by the government , and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power . The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan , or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS , can be understood also by looking at these groups &apos; efforts to provide security .
Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing : safety and security . They rise because they fill a gap left by the government , and they emerge to be both armed and political , engage in violent struggle and provide governance . Now , unfortunately , in these cases , the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population .

And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated , the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state . Is this a state ? Is it a rebel group ? They rise because they fill a gap left by the government , and they emerge to be both armed and political , engage in violent struggle and provide governance .
Now , this is a really complex picture , yet in the West , when we look at armed groups , we only think of the violent side . Is this a state ? Is it a rebel group ?
These groups are hybrid .

Now , what do you call a group like Hezbollah ? And what about ISIS ?
They rise because they fill a gap left by the government , and they emerge to be both armed and political , engage in violent struggle and provide governance . This matters for governments , because to counter these groups , they will have to invest more in non-military tools . We live in a world of states , non-states , and in-between , and the more states are weak , like in the Middle East today , the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap .






This matters for governments , because to counter these groups , they will have to invest more in non-military tools . If we better understand armed groups , we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence . So in this new contest between states and non-states , military power can win some battles , but it will not give us peace nor stability .
So in this new contest between states and non-states , military power can win some battles , but it will not give us peace nor stability . This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding .

Or at least , I wrote an essay , and then I wrote a book called &quot; Bad Feminist , &quot; and then in interviews , people started calling me The Bad Feminist .
Or at least , I wrote an essay , and then I wrote a book called &quot; Bad Feminist , &quot; and then in interviews , people started calling me The Bad Feminist . Oh , so I call myself a Bad Feminist .







As I got older , I began to accept that I am , indeed , a feminist , and a proud one . But back then , I worried about the tone people used when suggesting I might be a feminist . I hold certain truths to be self-evident : Women are equal to men .
The feminist label was an accusation , it was an &quot; F &quot; word , and not a nice one . We deserve equal pay for equal work . I hold certain truths to be self-evident : Women are equal to men .

We have the right to move through the world as we choose , free from harassment or violence . We have the right to make choices about our bodies , free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine . We have the right to respect .

We have the right to move through the world as we choose , free from harassment or violence . I hold certain truths to be self-evident : Women are equal to men . We have the right to easy , affordable access to birth control , and reproductive services .




When we talk about the needs of women , we have to consider the other identities we inhabit . I hold these truths to be self-evident , but let me be clear : I &apos;m a mess . There are many ways in which I &apos;m doing feminism wrong .



I hold these truths to be self-evident , but let me be clear : I &apos;m a mess . I am full of contradictions . I have another confession .



I firmly believe in man work , which is anything I don &apos;t want to do , including -- all domestic tasks , but also : bug killing , trash removal , lawn care and vehicle maintenance . Bitch , you gotta shake it &apos; til your camel starts to hurt ! &quot; Even though the lyrics are degrading to women -- these lyrics offend me to my core -- the classic Yin Yang Twins song &quot; Salt Shaker &quot; -- it is amazing .



I firmly believe in man work , which is anything I don &apos;t want to do , including -- all domestic tasks , but also : bug killing , trash removal , lawn care and vehicle maintenance . I want no part of any of that .






If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children , I embrace that choice , too . Some of my transgressions are more flagrant . The problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice ; the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose .
I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color , working-class women , queer women and transgender women , in favor of supporting white , middle- and upper-class straight women . I watch &quot; The Bachelor &quot; and romantic comedies , and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true .

There is also this : As a feminist , I feel a lot of pressure .

Let &apos;s deal with that .

Too many women , particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders , are afraid to be labeled as feminists . We expect them to pose perfectly .
Take , for example , Beyoncé , or as I call her , The Goddess .
We expect them to pose perfectly .

Take , for example , Beyoncé , or as I call her , The Goddess .


Too many women , particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders , are afraid to be labeled as feminists . As the moment faded , cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not Beyoncé was , indeed , a feminist . At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards , she performed in front of the word &quot; feminist &quot; 10 feet high .



We demand perfection from feminists , because we are still fighting for so much , we want so much , we need so damn much . As the moment faded , cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not Beyoncé was , indeed , a feminist .

They graded her feminism , instead of simply taking a grown , accomplished woman at her word .




But -- when I justify bad choices , I make it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve , and I need to own that . We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability , or walking the walk , and being a little bit brave . We go far beyond reasonable , constructive criticism , to dissecting any given woman &apos;s feminism , tearing it apart until there &apos;s nothing left .

We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability , or walking the walk , and being a little bit brave . But -- when I justify bad choices , I make it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve , and I need to own that . It &apos;s hard to make the better choice , and it is so easy to justify a lesser one .
If I listen to degrading music , I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply .
But -- when I justify bad choices , I make it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve , and I need to own that . I think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make . I think of my nieces , ages three and four .
It &apos;s hard to make the better choice , and it is so easy to justify a lesser one . We can all make better choices . I think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make .

I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are . We can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport , Game of Thrones . We can all make better choices .

It &apos;s hard to make the better choice , and it is so easy to justify a lesser one . But -- when I justify bad choices , I make it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all deserve , and I need to own that .



Those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects , can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling , and we are tokens no more .
We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don &apos;t treat women as anything more than decorative objects . Those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects , can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling , and we are tokens no more .

The last line of my book &quot; Bad Feminist &quot; says , &quot; I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all . &quot;





But -- I had writing . I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself . And there , I wrote myself back together .
I learned to write like them , and then I learned to write as myself . I wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself . I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine , and women who looked like me , and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin .

In one hand , I hold the power to accomplish anything .









Don &apos;t most science-savvy people know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S. ?



The few psychologists and pediatricians who &apos;d even heard of it figured they would get through their entire careers without seeing a single case . But then , in the 1990s , the numbers started to skyrocket . Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic , as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland .


If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta what &apos;s going on , they tend to rely on phrases like &quot; broadened diagnostic criteria &quot; and &quot; better case finding &quot; to explain these rising numbers . Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks routinely refer to autism as an epidemic , as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland . For decades , the prevalence estimates remained stable at just three or four children in 10,000 .



But then , in the 1990s , the numbers started to skyrocket .

If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta what &apos;s going on , they tend to rely on phrases like &quot; broadened diagnostic criteria &quot; and &quot; better case finding &quot; to explain these rising numbers . Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s ? There was a second , more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature .

I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science than it does with the seductive power of storytelling . For most of the 20th century , clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be wrong , and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health . There was a second , more accurate story of autism which had been lost and forgotten in obscure corners of the clinical literature .
Five years ago , I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions .

This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next . The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner . For most of the 20th century , clinicians told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be wrong , and the consequences of it are having a devastating impact on global public health .

The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital named Leo Kanner .

Kanner was a smart guy , but a number of his theories didn &apos;t pan out . He once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis . In 1943 , Kanner published a paper describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds , ignoring the people around them , even their own parents .


By the 1950s , as the world &apos;s leading authority on the subject , he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa . He once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians without giving them an autism diagnosis . That &apos;s actually not surprising , because Kanner &apos;s criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective .
At the same time , however , Kanner noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clustered in certain areas like music , math and memory . One boy in his clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two . Kanner was a smart guy , but a number of his theories didn &apos;t pan out .

By the 1950s , as the world &apos;s leading authority on the subject , he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa . These children , he said , had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn &apos;t defrost . That &apos;s actually not surprising , because Kanner &apos;s criteria for diagnosing autism were incredibly selective .


These children , he said , had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn &apos;t defrost . He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis caused by cold and unaffectionate parents . But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities , claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things they &apos;d heard their pompous parents say , desperate to earn their approval .



They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population .

As a result , autism became a source of shame and stigma for families , and two generations of autistic children were shipped off to institutions for their own good , becoming invisible to the world at large . To make the case to the National Health Service that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families , Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier . They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell to try to find autistic children in the community .

At first , they were at a loss to make sense of their data . What they saw made clear that Kanner &apos;s model was way too narrow , while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse .

In other words , these children didn &apos;t fit into nice , neat boxes , as Judith put it , and they saw lots of them , way more than Kanner &apos;s monolithic model would have predicted .

How had no one noticed these children before ?

Crucially , Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability . Instead of blaming parents for causing autism , Asperger framed it as a lifelong , polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one &apos;s whole life . Asperger &apos;s ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards .
Instead of blaming parents for causing autism , Asperger framed it as a lifelong , polygenetic disability that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations over the course of one &apos;s whole life . Its author was a man named Hans Asperger , who ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the 1930s .

Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents causing it .




Over the next several years , they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called &quot; the autism spectrum . &quot; By coincidence , as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time . Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients , Asperger called them his little professors , and enlisted their help in developing methods of education that were particularly suited to them .

In the late &apos; 80s and early 1990s , their changes went into effect , swapping out Kanner &apos;s narrow model for Asperger &apos;s broad and inclusive one . The combination of &quot; Rain Man , &quot; the changes to the criteria , and the introduction of these tests created a network effect , a perfect storm of autism awareness . Over the next several years , they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association to broaden the criteria for diagnosis to reflect the diversity of what they called &quot; the autism spectrum . &quot;


Before &quot; Rain Man &quot; came out in 1988 , only a tiny , ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like , but after Dustin Hoffman &apos;s unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt earned &quot; Rain Man &quot; four Academy Awards , pediatricians , psychologists , teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like . By coincidence , as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time . The combination of &quot; Rain Man , &quot; the changes to the criteria , and the introduction of these tests created a network effect , a perfect storm of autism awareness .

In recent years , autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved by the next medical breakthrough , coining the term &quot; neurodiversity &quot; to celebrate the varieties of human cognition . By coincidence , as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes to reform the criteria , people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time . If the CDC &apos;s current estimate , that one in 68 kids in America are on the spectrum , is correct , autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world .


To be sure , autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them . The number of diagnoses started to soar , just as Lorna and Judith predicted , indeed hoped , that it would , enabling autistic people and their families to finally get the support and services they deserved . By autistic standards , the normal human brain is easily distractable , obsessively social , and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail .

One way to understand neurodiversity is to think in terms of human operating systems .
To be sure , autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them . Seventy years later , we &apos;re still catching up to Asperger , who believed that the &quot; cure &quot; for the most disabling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers , accommodating employers , supportive communities , and parents who have faith in their children &apos;s potential .

In it , he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran . But it &apos;s another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact . Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden &apos;s name , Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans .
And along the way , he became the face for the US government &apos;s recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists .


In it , he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran . You see , under the First Amendment , the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest . So from 2007 to 2015 , Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison .


You see , under the First Amendment , the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest .
But it &apos;s impossible to exercise that right if the media can &apos;t also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them . And along the way , he became the face for the US government &apos;s recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists . Suddenly , after years of claiming it was vital to their case , the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether .
And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify , they could have his digital trail testify against him instead . So when the government came knocking , Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him : he refused and said he &apos;d rather go to jail . But it &apos;s impossible to exercise that right if the media can &apos;t also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them .
Suddenly , after years of claiming it was vital to their case , the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether . And along the way , he became the face for the US government &apos;s recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists . So completely in secret and without his consent , prosecutors got Risen &apos;s phone records .

They got his email records , his financial and banking information , his credit reports , even travel records with a list of flights he had taken .
It turns out , in the age of electronic surveillance , there are very few places reporters and sources can hide .

President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers , and instead , his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined .

Since 9 / 11 , virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist . So completely in secret and without his consent , prosecutors got Risen &apos;s phone records . So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government &apos;s expanded ability to spy on everyone .
For example , one such tool is SecureDrop , an open-source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz , and is now developed at the non-profit where I work , Freedom of the Press Foundation .


President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers , and instead , his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined . So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government &apos;s expanded ability to spy on everyone . But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters &apos; rights , the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before .





Communications software now exists that wasn &apos;t available when Risen was writing his book , and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls . It &apos;ll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to . Unfortunately , governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk .

From there , you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form .

SecureDrop , though , is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century . After all , these tools weren &apos;t just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes , but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution .
And it &apos;s up to us going forward to make sure that it &apos;s not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers , like Edward Snowden , who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing . SecureDrop , though , is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century . Unfortunately , governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk .



&#91; On April 3 , 2016 we saw the largest data leak in history . &#93; &#91; The Panama Papers exposed rich and powerful people &#93; &#91; hiding vast amounts of money in offshore accounts . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; We called Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain . &#93; This week , there have been a whole slew and deluge of stories coming out from the leak of 11 million documents from a Panamanian-based law firm called Mossack Fonseca . So you actually get to see the emails , you get to see the exchanges of messages , you get to see the mechanics of how this works , how this operates .

So you actually get to see the emails , you get to see the exchanges of messages , you get to see the mechanics of how this works , how this operates .

The release of these papers from Panama lifts the veil on a tiny piece of the secretive offshore world . And there will be a lot of rich individuals out there and others who will be nervous about the next set of stories and the next set of leaked documents . There &apos;s been allegations of a $ 2 billion money trail that leads back to President Vladimir Putin of Russia via his close childhood friend , who happens to be a top cellist .
We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies .
But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .

We &apos;ve also had news that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has also got offshore companies .
Now , this has already started to have pretty immediate repercussions .
We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade . But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads . Now , this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel .

But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads . Now , for my organization Global Witness , this exposé has been phenomenal . We have the world &apos;s media and political leaders talking about how individuals can use offshore secrecy to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been talking about and exposing for a decade .
Now , I think a lot of people find this entire world baffling and confusing , and hard to understand how this sort of offshore world works . So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .

It can be very difficult for law enforcement or tax authorities , journalists , civil society to really understand what &apos;s going on .
Now , that &apos;s not because there are no rich Americans who are stashing their assets offshore . And that &apos;s perhaps because some prominent US people just haven &apos;t figured in this exposé , in this scandal . But the truth is that if rich and powerful individuals are able to keep their money offshore and not pay the taxes that they should , it means that there is less money for vital public services like healthcare , education , roads .


It &apos;s just because of the way in which offshore works , Mossack Fonseca has fewer American clients . In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .
I also think it &apos;s interesting that there &apos;s been less coverage of this issue in the United States .
So you can have one company stacked inside another company , stacked inside another company , making it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .

So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms . In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card . I think if we saw leaks from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware or Wyoming or Nevada , you would see many more cases and examples linking back to Americans .
So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms . Now , at Global Witness , we wanted to see what this actually looked like in practice . In fact , in a number of US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to get a company than you do to get a library card .

Now , what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds .
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to move suspect funds into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a jet . So what we did is we sent in an undercover investigator to 13 Manhattan law firms . These were all preliminary meetings , and none of the lawyers took us on as a client and of course no money moved hands , but it really shows the problem with the system .

This is not just about an individual lawyer who &apos;s spoken to our undercover investigator and provided suggestions .
It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who &apos;s been caught up in a scandal . Now , what was truly shocking was that all but one of those lawyers provided our investigator with suggestions on how to move those suspect funds .

It &apos;s not just about a particular senior politician who &apos;s been caught up in a scandal . It &apos;s also important to not just think about this as individual cases . This is about how a system works , that entrenches corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .




So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world . And since then , the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe . There &apos;s bipartisan legislation that had been introduced in the House and the Senate , but it isn &apos;t making as much progress as we &apos;d like to see .
So we &apos;d really want to see the Panama leaks , this huge peek into the offshore world , be used as a way of opening up in the US and around the world . Over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve seen a real push towards greater transparency when it comes to company ownership . We need to change the rules of the game to make this sort of behavior harder .


And since then , the European Union is going to be creating central registers at a national level of who really owns and controls companies across Europe .

We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy . We need business leaders to stand up and say , &quot; Secrecy like this is not good for business . &quot; For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .

We need ordinary people to get angry at the way in which people can hide their identity behind secret companies .
We need political leaders to recognize the problem , and to commit to changing the law to open up this sort of secrecy . For us at Global Witness , this is a moment for change .
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff .

I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata .
It &apos;s the day after graduating from design school and I &apos;m having a yard sale . As I motion for the tab , I make the mistake of asking him , &quot; So where are you staying tonight ? &quot; And he makes it worse by saying , &quot; Actually , I don &apos;t have a place . &quot;





Now it &apos;s starting to get late , and I &apos;m getting pretty tired .


And he makes it worse by saying , &quot; Actually , I don &apos;t have a place . &quot; As I motion for the tab , I make the mistake of asking him , &quot; So where are you staying tonight ? &quot; So then I hear myself saying , &quot; Hey , I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room . &quot;
Do I offer to host this guy ?


So then I hear myself saying , &quot; Hey , I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room . &quot; That night , I &apos;m laying in bed , I &apos;m staring at the ceiling and thinking , &quot; Oh my god , what have I done ? But , I just met him -- I mean , he says he &apos;s going to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t really know if he &apos;s going to the Peace Corps and I don &apos;t want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata .

So then I hear myself saying , &quot; Hey , I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room . &quot;
It turns out he was not psychotic . So then I hear myself saying , &quot; Hey , I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room . &quot;

What if he &apos;s psychotic ? &quot;


The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco , I brought the airbed with me . And then I learn there &apos;s a design conference coming to town , and all the hotels are sold out . I &apos;m unemployed , I &apos;m almost broke , my roommate moves out , and then the rent goes up .

This was my first hosting experience , and it completely changed my perspective . So here &apos;s what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky : &quot; Brian , thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into &apos; designers bed and breakfast , &apos; offering young designers who come to town a place to crash , complete with wireless Internet , a small desk space , sleeping mat , and breakfast each morning .

We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born .





But they loved it , and so did we . I swear , the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests . We took them on adventures around the city , and when we said goodbye to the last guest , the door latch clicked , Brian and I just stared at each other .



And then , over the Internet , they &apos;re going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes . Here &apos;s what we pitched investors : &quot; We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces , their bedrooms , the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over . The wheels had started to turn .

Now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .

I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve . Because we &apos;ve all been taught as kids , strangers equal danger .
Is it possible to design for trust ? In art school , you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it &apos;s the whole experience . Now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
Could design make that happen ? Now , when you &apos;re faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design . In art school , you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it &apos;s the whole experience .
We learned to do that for objects , but here , we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met . Is it possible to design for trust ? I &apos;ve got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone .



OK , I need you to take out your phones . Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left .
Now , how does it feel holding someone &apos;s unlocked phone ? Now that you have your phone out , I &apos;d like you to unlock your phone .
Most of us feel really responsible . Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home . That &apos;s how most guests feel when they stay in a home .
People don &apos;t just see your messages , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . That &apos;s how most guests feel when they stay in a home .

Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left . Now that you have your phone out , I &apos;d like you to unlock your phone .
That &apos;s how most guests feel when they stay in a home . That tiny sense of panic you &apos;re feeling right now -- is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home .








What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first , with their name , where they &apos;re from , the name of their kids or their dog ? What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment ? So now that you &apos;ve experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing , I &apos;d love to share a few discoveries we &apos;ve made along the way .


What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment ?

Now , here &apos;s a discovery we made just last week .


Now , that &apos;s a natural social bias . The more different somebody is , the less we trust them .
We did a joint study with Stanford , where we looked at people &apos;s willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age , location and geography . The research showed , not surprisingly , we prefer people who are like us . High reputation beats high similarity .
The research showed , not surprisingly , we prefer people who are like us . High reputation beats high similarity . We did a joint study with Stanford , where we looked at people &apos;s willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age , location and geography .



The more different somebody is , the less we trust them . But if you &apos;ve got more than 10 , everything changes . Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure .


We use the size of the box to suggest the right length , and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing .
And if you share too much , like , &quot; I &apos;m having issues with my mother , &quot; acceptance rates also go down . But if you &apos;ve got more than 10 , everything changes . Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure .
If you share too little , like , &quot; Yo , &quot; acceptance rates go down . We use the size of the box to suggest the right length , and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing . Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure .
This is what happens when a guest first messages a host . We use the size of the box to suggest the right length , and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing . The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases .

So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure ? But there &apos;s a zone that &apos;s just right , like , &quot; Love the artwork in your place . Coming for vacation with my family . &quot;



And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need . The first , an unbelievable amount of luck . So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure ?
The second is the efforts of our team . There &apos;s three things happening here .

The second is the efforts of our team . The first , an unbelievable amount of luck . There &apos;s three things happening here .
The first , an unbelievable amount of luck . I was at the front lines of trust breaking .

Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain .





Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain . We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay , and he suffered a heart attack . The host rushed him to the hospital .
Thankfully , out of the 123 million nights we &apos;ve ever hosted , less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic .





And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you . The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals . Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you .
They don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books to read . &quot; Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions . We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay , and he suffered a heart attack .
Highly recommended ! &quot;






Highly recommended ! &quot; So let &apos;s be clear ; it is about commerce . They don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books to read .

But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for .
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ? But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for . The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection .

How do sharing and transactions go together ? The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection . You know how most travel today is , like , I think of it like fast food -- it &apos;s efficient and consistent , at the cost of local and authentic .
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ? What if anywhere you visited , there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn &apos;t even know existed .
What if anywhere you visited , there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn &apos;t even know existed . You know how most travel today is , like , I think of it like fast food -- it &apos;s efficient and consistent , at the cost of local and authentic . But if you just called it the rental economy , it would be incomplete .
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ?


What if cities embraced a culture of sharing ? I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation . Today , homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation .

They &apos;ve repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents . What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up ? They &apos;re connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms .
What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up ? What if cities embraced a culture of sharing ?
I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation . And they &apos;ve started an incubator to help fund the next generation Tonight , just on our service , 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger &apos;s home or welcome one into theirs . What if cities embraced a culture of sharing ?
What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up ? What if cities embraced a culture of sharing ? I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation .


I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation . Hospitality has been around forever .
So , why did ours eventually take off ? There &apos;s been many other websites like ours . Luck and timing aside , I &apos;ve learned that you can take the components of trust , and you can design for that .

And that &apos;s amazing to me . Clearly , it &apos;s not as crazy as we were taught . We didn &apos;t invent anything new .
There &apos;s been many other websites like ours . We didn &apos;t invent anything new . Clearly , it &apos;s not as crazy as we were taught .
Now , we know design won &apos;t solve all the world &apos;s problems .

It blows my mind . But if it can help out with this one , if it can make a dent in this , it makes me wonder , what else can we design for next ? I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by .



Now , we know design won &apos;t solve all the world &apos;s problems . Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias .




A woman of faith ? An expert ?
That one &apos;s actually true . That &apos;s just how the media has been portraying people who look like me . If some of your perceptions were negative , I don &apos;t really blame you .

One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .
Or oppressed , brainwashed , a terrorist . Well , for those of you who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to meet you . One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .

One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative . I &apos;m a mom , a coffee lover -- double espresso , cream on the side . Well , for those of you who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to meet you .

And I &apos;m a practicing , spiritual Muslim . If some of your perceptions were negative , I don &apos;t really blame you . I guess people don &apos;t talk to their Uber drivers .








When I was 17 , I decided to come out .
The funny thing was , it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old , to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty . But not like Lady Gaga says , because baby , I wasn &apos;t born this way .

I wrestled with the Quran . It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran . My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight .







Have you ever felt like someone sees you , completely understands you and yet loves you anyway ? I see myself in it . I feel that God knows me . Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears .
And then that terrible morning of September , 2001 . I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast , and I look up on the screen and see the words &quot; Breaking News . &quot; I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning .
And so later , I got married , and like all good Egyptians , started my career as an engineer .











And I switch the channel and I hear , ... &quot; Muslim terrorist ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; Middle-Eastern descent ... , &quot; ... &quot; jihad ... , &quot; ... &quot; we should bomb Mecca . &quot;
We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world .


And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence , crouched as low as I could go in my seat , for the first time in my life , afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim . And then it was Friday that same week , the day that Muslims congregate for worship . Emotions were so raw , understandably , and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims , or people who were perceived to be Muslim , being pulled out and beaten in the street .


And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be aware , &quot; &quot; Stay in well-lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t congregate . &quot; And then it was Friday that same week , the day that Muslims congregate for worship .


Guess what ? So was I. Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country . And then it was Friday that same week , the day that Muslims congregate for worship .





I don &apos;t mind questions . I love questions . Today we hear people actually saying things like , &quot; There &apos;s a problem in this country , and it &apos;s called Muslims .

And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn &apos;t easy . I don &apos;t mind questions . I love questions .
So , some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques . When are we going to get rid of them ? &quot; You know , a malignant tumor you extract altogether , and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance .

You know , a malignant tumor you extract altogether , and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance . I don &apos;t mind questions . I love questions . They talk about my community kind of like we &apos;re a tumor in the body of America .

They talk about my community kind of like we &apos;re a tumor in the body of America . So , some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques . Today we hear people actually saying things like , &quot; There &apos;s a problem in this country , and it &apos;s called Muslims .








Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement .

They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom , in front of a computer .

So if we want to prevent radicalization , we have to keep people going to the mosque .





But when you look at them , they &apos;re not motivated by what they read in their holy book . ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity . After all , a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran .
Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book . It &apos;s their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture . ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity .



What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS . And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger , she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution . And he said the problem was quite the opposite , that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage , her sense of injustice in the world , was just going to get her in trouble .


And he said the problem was quite the opposite , that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage , her sense of injustice in the world , was just going to get her in trouble . He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking of going to join ISIS .

And he said the problem was quite the opposite , that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage , her sense of injustice in the world , was just going to get her in trouble .




How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy , the health of our free thought ? I &apos;ve told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family . When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013 , it happened three times , but it wasn &apos;t around terrorist attacks .

We become more accepting of authoritarianism , conformity and prejudice . It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles .
Well , one study -- actually , several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we &apos;re afraid , at least three things happen . We become more accepting of authoritarianism , conformity and prejudice .



So Islamophobia isn &apos;t just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected . When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013 , it happened three times , but it wasn &apos;t around terrorist attacks .


It can actually be a tool of public manipulation , eroding the very foundation of a free society , which is rational and well-informed citizens . So Islamophobia isn &apos;t just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected . Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine .


She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume , and she was amazed . And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest , most generous human being she knew . Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .

Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
Deah was an athlete . She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume , and she was amazed . Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .


Just a few weeks after Suzanne &apos;s visit to her brother and his new wife , their neighbor , Craig Stephen Hicks , murdered them , as well as Yusor &apos;s sister , Razan , who was visiting for the afternoon , in their apartment , execution style , after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page .







And then the imam made an announcement , thanking and welcoming our guests , because half the congregation were Christians , Jews , Buddhists , atheists , people of faith and no faith , who had come not to attack us , but to stand in solidarity with us . So we decided to go to the mosque . Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home ?

These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice . What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry ? So we decided to go to the mosque .
The place was completely full . And then the imam made an announcement , thanking and welcoming our guests , because half the congregation were Christians , Jews , Buddhists , atheists , people of faith and no faith , who had come not to attack us , but to stand in solidarity with us . I took him out , I took off my shoes , I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop .
What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry ?
What will you choose ? Will you play it safe ?
What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry ? Or will you join those who say we are better than that ? But I wonder , what would you say to those who might argue that you &apos;re giving a TED Talk , you &apos;re clearly a deep thinker , you work at a fancy think tank , you &apos;re an exception , you &apos;re not the rule .
But I wonder , what would you say to those who might argue that you &apos;re giving a TED Talk , you &apos;re clearly a deep thinker , you work at a fancy think tank , you &apos;re an exception , you &apos;re not the rule . Helen Walters : So Dalia , you seem to have struck a chord . Thank you so much .





I am as ordinary as they come . My story is not unusual . When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I &apos;ve done this , I &apos;ve done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things .

I am as ordinary as they come . When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule , oftentimes it &apos;s that the rule is broken , not that they &apos;re an exception to it . Dalia Mogahed : I would say , don &apos;t let this stage distract you , I &apos;m completely ordinary .

They want prosperity for their family , they want jobs and they want to live in peace . I am as ordinary as they come . Dalia Mogahed : I would say , don &apos;t let this stage distract you , I &apos;m completely ordinary .

HW : Thank you so much . Dalia Mogahed .





Inspection , environmental monitoring , photography and film and journalism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones , and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world . Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight . For example , before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France , and several years ago , they started to fly with ropes .

Back at our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to locate objects , which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks . For the demos you will see today , however , we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios , a spin-off from our lab . Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight .

Now , for a system to function autonomously , it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space .
Skills learned include how to carry loads , how to cope with disturbances , and in general , how to interact with the physical world .
Now , for a system to function autonomously , it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space .

The only external commands are high-level ones such as &quot; take off &quot; and &quot; land . &quot; Back at our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to locate objects , which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks . Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be .
Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft , however , it is capable of hovering , which has huge advantages for takeoff , landing and general versatility . Like other fixed-wing aircraft , it is efficient in forward flight , much more so than helicopters and variations thereof . The only external commands are high-level ones such as &quot; take off &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;

Like other fixed-wing aircraft , it is efficient in forward flight , much more so than helicopters and variations thereof . Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft , however , it is capable of hovering , which has huge advantages for takeoff , landing and general versatility .

This is a so-called tail-sitter .


We &apos;re developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation .

The only external commands are high-level ones such as &quot; take off &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;




We &apos;re developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation .
It turns out that decades ago , skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a propeller and a tail rudder . This is the monospinner , the world &apos;s mechanically simplest controllable flying machine , invented just a few months ago . We &apos;re developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation .


For example , one such question would be , what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight ? It has only one moving part , a propeller . Helicopters , for example , are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm .
When doing research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter . Now , there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question . For example , one such question would be , what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight ?
It has no flaps , no hinges , no ailerons , no other actuators , no other control surfaces , just a simple propeller . And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low , given everybody watching me , what we &apos;re going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night . Even so , it doesn &apos;t yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter , which means that in order to get it to fly , I have to throw it just right .

This is the monospinner , the world &apos;s mechanically simplest controllable flying machine , invented just a few months ago .

This is the monospinner , the world &apos;s mechanically simplest controllable flying machine , invented just a few months ago . Even though it &apos;s mechanically simple , there &apos;s a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space . If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality , this machine here , the omnicopter , with its eight propellers , is an exercise in excess .

This gives it an extraordinary capability . It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating .

If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality , this machine here , the omnicopter , with its eight propellers , is an exercise in excess . If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives , they will need to become extremely safe and reliable . It has its own complexities , mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers .
As a result , it is ambivalent to orientation . The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric . It has its own complexities , mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers .

The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric .

This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines . If anything goes wrong , however -- a motor fails , a propeller fails , electronics , even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly , albeit in a degraded fashion .

This other one wants to spin counterclockwise . We &apos;re going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves .

We &apos;ve taken commercially available micro quadcopters , each weighing less than a slice of bread , by the way , and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms . Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled , there is really no limit to their number . Hopefully , these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines .
And for folks like us , the real reward is the journey and the act of creation . The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology . That ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway .

For that brief moment in time , the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe . All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself , making the Universe explode in gravitational waves . I mean , you know , they &apos;re black holes .
And about 25 years ago , a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT , Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes . For that brief moment in time , the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe . 1.3 billion years ago , in a distant , distant galaxy , two black holes locked into a spiral , converting three Suns &apos; worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
And about 25 years ago , a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT , Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes .

But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea .


Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here . Since then , Earth has made and evolved corals , fish , plants , dinosaurs , people and even -- God save us -- the Internet . 1.3 billion years ago , Earth had just managed to evolve multicellular life .


So after decades of development , construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work , they built their detector , called LIGO : The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory . And they passed through you and me . But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea .











For example , the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes , every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit , they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21 . &quot; It stretches and expands , it stretches and expands . &quot;


Everything I &apos;d been working on -- it &apos;s no longer science fiction ! Allan Adams : So that &apos;s my very good friend and collaborator , Scott Hughes , a theoretical physicist at MIT , who has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO , So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave . A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time . So towards the end of his classic text on gravity , described the hunt for gravitational waves as follows : He said , &quot; The technical difficulties to be surmounted in constructing such detectors are enormous .

This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity .


For example , the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes , every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit , they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21 . Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that &apos;s already crazy -- they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom . Visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone .

Visible light has a wavelength , a size , that &apos;s much smaller than the things around you , the features on people &apos;s faces , the size of your cell phone . I want to explain what that means . Thorne published that in 1973 , 42 years before he succeeded .



And that makes it really difficult -- in fact , in practical purposes , impossible -- to make an image of something you really care about . We can &apos;t use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe .
That &apos;s Bob interrupting . Sound is different . Silly Bob .




So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air , into sound , we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us . For example , listening to gravity , just in this way , can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about . And at least for LIGO , the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band .
But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves , we can hear the story that those waves are telling .

But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves , we can hear the story that those waves are telling . And at least for LIGO , the frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band . AA : So on September 14 , 2015 , a date that &apos;s definitely going to live in my memory , LIGO heard this : &#91; Whirring sound &#93; So if you know how to listen , that is the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes , each of about 30 solar masses , that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender .
If the two bodies are spinning very rapidly , I have that same chirp , but with a modulation on top of it , so it kind of goes : whir , whir , whir ! It &apos;s sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform .
SH : If the two black holes are non-spinning , you get a very simple chirp : whoop ! Two black holes , the densest thing in the Universe , one with a mass of 29 Suns and one with a mass of 36 Suns , whirling around each other 100 times per second before they collide . AA : So on September 14 , 2015 , a date that &apos;s definitely going to live in my memory , LIGO heard this : &#91; Whirring sound &#93; So if you know how to listen , that is the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes , each of about 30 solar masses , that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender .

SH : If the two black holes are non-spinning , you get a very simple chirp : whoop ! So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air , into sound , we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us .



It &apos;s an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we &apos;ve never had before . AA : So on September 14 , 2015 , a date that &apos;s definitely going to live in my memory , LIGO heard this : &#91; Whirring sound &#93; So if you know how to listen , that is the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes , each of about 30 solar masses , that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender . It &apos;s sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform .

AA : It &apos;s worth pausing here to think about what that means .

We &apos;ll never see through it , it &apos;s opaque to light . And there &apos;s a lot out there that we can &apos;t see -- in practice or even in principle .


That &apos;s the lasting importance of LIGO . With gravitational waves , we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning . It &apos;s a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible .
We &apos;ll never see through it , it &apos;s opaque to light . It &apos;s a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible . So supernova , for example : I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae .
Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- The Big Bang : I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe , but we &apos;ll never see them , because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow . The problem is , all the interesting physics happens in the core , and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon . So supernova , for example : I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae .

Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- The Big Bang : I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe , but we &apos;ll never see them , because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow . Here &apos;s my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration , Matt Evans , my colleague at MIT , addressing exactly that : Matt Evans : The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe .

Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- The Big Bang : I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe , but we &apos;ll never see them , because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow . Perhaps most importantly , I &apos;m positive that there are things out there that we &apos;ve never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven &apos;t even imagined -- things that we &apos;ll only discover by listening . AA : Our challenge now is to be as audacious as possible .
Here &apos;s my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration , Matt Evans , my colleague at MIT , addressing exactly that : Matt Evans : The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe .
They &apos;re these massive things that are old , from prehistoric times , and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology .
Our job now is to dream big . And in fact , even in that very first event , LIGO found things that we didn &apos;t expect .

Our job now is to dream big .







Did I want to be on live TV ? For one year , I would say yes to all the things that scared me . Did I want to try acting ?

So a while ago , I tried an experiment . And a crazy thing happened : the very act of doing the thing that scared me made it not scary . Anything that made me nervous , took me out of my comfort zone , I forced myself to say yes to .





I have these three amazing daughters , Harper , Beckett and Emerson , and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as &quot; honey . &quot; But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way , in a way I never imagined , and it started with a question from my toddler . My fear of public speaking , my social anxiety , poof , gone .

&quot; Yes &quot; changed my life . But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way , in a way I never imagined , and it started with a question from my toddler . And a crazy thing happened : the very act of doing the thing that scared me made it not scary .


The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening when I was on my way somewhere , and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;

as though she &apos;s a Southern waitress . I made a vow that from now on , every time one of my children asks me to play , no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I say yes , every single time . But it &apos;s also had a stunning side effect , and it wasn &apos;t until recently that I fully understood it , that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career .

I create television . I executive produce television .










My brain is global , and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced , so on top of everything else , I need to find time , real quiet , creative time , to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories . Four television programs , 70 hours of TV -- Three shows in production at a time , sometimes four . A new episode made every nine days times four shows , so every nine days that &apos;s 20 million dollars worth of television , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows in production at a time , sometimes four , 16 episodes going on at all times : 24 episodes of &quot; Grey &apos;s , &quot; 21 episodes of &quot; Scandal , &quot; 15 episodes of &quot; How To Get Away With Murder , &quot; 10 episodes of &quot; The Catch , &quot; that &apos;s 70 hours of TV ,

It is manning the troops . It is painting a canvas . It is hitting every high note . It is running a marathon .

I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard , whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home , take me seriously when I talk about working , so you &apos;ll get that I don &apos;t peck at a computer and imagine all day , so you &apos;ll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming . And it is all of those things at the same time . It is hitting every high note . It is running a marathon .



There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good . And a lot of people , when I try to explain the hum , they assume that I &apos;m talking about the writing , that my writing brings me joy . For me , my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air .

But the hum -- it wasn &apos;t until I started making television that I started working , working and making and building and creating and collaborating , that I discovered this thing , this buzz , this rush , this hum . It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious , and what makes it all so good is the hum . And a lot of people , when I try to explain the hum , they assume that I &apos;m talking about the writing , that my writing brings me joy .

But the hum -- it wasn &apos;t until I started making television that I started working , working and making and building and creating and collaborating , that I discovered this thing , this buzz , this rush , this hum . The hum is action and activity . The hum is a drug . The hum is music . The hum is light and air .


And when you have a hum like that , you can &apos;t help but strive for greatness .


Maybe it &apos;s called ego . Maybe it &apos;s called genius . Or , maybe it &apos;s called being a workaholic .

Maybe it &apos;s called genius . Or , maybe it &apos;s called being a workaholic . That &apos;s called the hum .


I love working , right ?
The nation I &apos;m building , the marathon I &apos;m running , the troops , the canvas , the high note , the hum , the hum , the hum . I love working , right ? And what did I say about work ?
The more I work to be successful , the more I need to work . I just know that I &apos;m not built for failure , and I just know that I love the hum . Maybe it &apos;s just fear of failure .
The nation I &apos;m building , the marathon I &apos;m running , the troops , the canvas , the high note , the hum , the hum , the hum . I need that hum . I am that hum . I like that hum . I love that hum .

And what did I say about work ? The more I work to be successful , the more I need to work . I just know that I &apos;m not built for failure , and I just know that I love the hum .
The more I work to be successful , the more I need to work . But here &apos;s the thing : the more successful I become , the more shows , the more episodes , the more barriers broken , the more work there is to do , the more balls in the air , the more eyes on me , the more history stares , the more expectations there are .

The more I work to be successful , the more I need to work . And then the hum stopped . The nation I &apos;m building , the marathon I &apos;m running , the troops , the canvas , the high note , the hum , the hum , the hum .

The hum stopped . The nation I &apos;m building , the marathon I &apos;m running , the troops , the canvas , the high note , the hum , the hum , the hum . I like that hum . I love that hum .


Overworked , overused , overdone , burned out .
The hum of the engine died .




The hum would not come back . My hum was broken . I stopped loving work . I couldn &apos;t restart the engine .
I was doing the same things I always did , all the same titan work , 15-hour days , working straight through the weekends , no regrets , never surrender , a titan never sleeps , a titan never quits , full hearts , clear eyes , yada , whatever .





I was doing the same things I always did , all the same titan work , 15-hour days , working straight through the weekends , no regrets , never surrender , a titan never sleeps , a titan never quits , full hearts , clear eyes , yada , whatever . But there was no hum . The hum would not come back .

I was a titan you could take home to your mother . I was doing the same things I always did , all the same titan work , 15-hour days , working straight through the weekends , no regrets , never surrender , a titan never sleeps , a titan never quits , full hearts , clear eyes , yada , whatever . But there was no hum .












One , I &apos;m supposed to say yes to everything , and two , my Southern waitress didn &apos;t call me &quot; honey . &quot;


And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question . And I &apos;m just about to say no , when I realize two things . And I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;


She &apos;s not calling everyone &quot; honey &quot; anymore .



And yet , it is extraordinary , because in my pain and my panic , in the homelessness of my humlessness , I have nothing to do but pay attention .

There &apos;s nothing special about it . Nothing out of the ordinary . It &apos;s all peace and simplicity .
And yet , it is extraordinary , because in my pain and my panic , in the homelessness of my humlessness , I have nothing to do but pay attention . The nation I &apos;m building , the marathon I &apos;m running , the troops , the canvas , the high note does not exist . The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe .
All that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of . It &apos;s all peace and simplicity . I focus .

The nation I &apos;m building , the marathon I &apos;m running , the troops , the canvas , the high note does not exist .


The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe . A door in my brain swings open , and a rush of energy comes . And it &apos;s not instantaneous , but it happens , it does happen .

It &apos;s all peace and simplicity . Play is the opposite of work . Something in me loosens .


A door in my brain swings open , and a rush of energy comes . Something in me loosens . I feel it .
A door in my brain swings open , and a rush of energy comes . Something in me loosens . Not at full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , and I have to stay very still to hear it , but it is there .
Something in me loosens . Not at full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , and I have to stay very still to hear it , but it is there . A door in my brain swings open , and a rush of energy comes .


No magic . No secret . It &apos;s just love . It &apos;s just love . That &apos;s all it is . Not the hum , but a hum .



The hum , the work hum , the hum of the titan , that &apos;s just a replacement . And now I feel like I know a very magical secret . If I have to ask you who I am , if I have to tell you who I am , if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is , I have forgotten what the real hum is .

The real hum is confidence and peace . The real hum is love-specific . The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific .
The hum is joy-specific . The real hum is love-specific . The hum , the work hum , the hum of the titan , that &apos;s just a replacement .
The real hum is love-specific . The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific . The real hum ignores the stare of history , and the balls in the air , and the expectation , and the pressure .
The hum is joy-specific . The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific . The real hum is confidence and peace .

The real hum is love-specific . The real hum ignores the stare of history , and the balls in the air , and the expectation , and the pressure .
The real hum is confidence and peace . The real hum is love-specific . The real hum is God &apos;s whisper in my ear , but maybe God was whispering the wrong words , because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan ?

The real hum is confidence and peace . The real hum ignores the stare of history , and the balls in the air , and the expectation , and the pressure . The real hum is love-specific .


I wish it were that easy , but I &apos;m not good at playing . The real hum ignores the stare of history , and the balls in the air , and the expectation , and the pressure .
Any time my child asks me to play , I will say yes . I &apos;m not interested in doing it the way I &apos;m interested in doing work .
The real hum is God &apos;s whisper in my ear , but maybe God was whispering the wrong words , because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan ? The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face . It &apos;s just love .


Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle , because what kind of person likes working more than being at home ? I make it a firm rule for one reason , to give myself permission , to free me from all of my workaholic guilt .
I wish it were that easy , but I &apos;m not good at playing .


I like working more than I like being at home . I work all the time because I like working . The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face .



And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time . Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle , because what kind of person likes working more than being at home ? I like working more than I like being at home .



We have 30-second dance parties . We sing show tunes . We play with balls . And one of those issues isn &apos;t that I am too relaxed .

You can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play . I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place . We run around the yard , up and back and up and back .
You can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play . My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up . I blow bubbles and they pop them .
You can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play .
My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up .
I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place . My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up .

Are you thinking that maybe I &apos;m an idiot in diamond shoes ? You can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play .


If I &apos;m not a ladybug or a piece of candy , I &apos;m invisible after 15 minutes . My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else .

And my 13-year-old , if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I &apos;m Parent of the Year . I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day . Your child does not think you &apos;re that interesting .




And my 13-year-old , if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes I &apos;m Parent of the Year . It &apos;s an amazing 15 minutes , but it &apos;s 15 minutes . My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else .






Just figure it out and play in that arena . &quot; Wanna play ? &quot; starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I &apos;d given up on right around the time I got my first TV show , right around the time I became a titan-in-training , right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown .


I &apos;m not perfect at it . In fact , I fail as often as I succeed , seeing friends , reading books , staring into space . Turns out , nothing . 15 minutes ? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes ?




It takes a little time , but after a few months , one day the floodgates open and there &apos;s a rush , and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody , full on groove inside me , and around me , and it sends me spinning with ideas , and the humming road is open , and I can drive it and drive it , and I love working again .
The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return , as if the hum &apos;s engine could only refuel while I was away . I don &apos;t need that hum . But now , I like that hum , but I don &apos;t love that hum .

I am not that hum . That hum is not me , not anymore .
I am that hum .

Work &apos;s hum is still a piece of me , it is just no longer all of me , and I am so grateful .





The more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . The more I play , the freer my mind becomes . The more I play , the happier I am , and the happier my kids are .

The more I play , the freer my mind becomes .

The more I play , the happier I am , and the happier my kids are . The more I play , the freer my mind becomes .

That &apos;s the dream of the job .



If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; p &quot; in the score , you need to play softer . Two p &apos;s -- even softer . Piano , &quot; p , &quot; is my favorite musical symbol .
Two p &apos;s -- even softer . It means to play softly . Four p &apos;s -- extremely soft .
Four p &apos;s -- extremely soft . If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; p &quot; in the score , you need to play softer .
Two p &apos;s -- even softer . If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; p &quot; in the score , you need to play softer .




Sound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .



So it has a history of about 200 years . And I believed it to be true .

I was born deaf , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life . As a Deaf person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , blindly following its rules , customs , behaviors and norms without ever questioning them .
At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me . I learn and mirror that behavior . As a Deaf person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , blindly following its rules , customs , behaviors and norms without ever questioning them .
Well , I watch how people behave and respond to sound .

You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound .
I learn and mirror that behavior . You people are like my loudspeakers , and amplify sound . So how is it that I understand sound ?


Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does . I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound . At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me .
TBD , to be decided .

Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does . I &apos;m hyper-vigilant around sound . All of these things I term &quot; sound etiquette . &quot;



This is a sign for &quot; staff &quot; in ASL . A typical staff contains five lines . And you notice the staff -- there are no notes contained in the lines .
A typical staff contains five lines . That &apos;s because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears .
In Deaf culture , movement is equivalent to sound .

At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ... there was no visual art , everything was auditory . Now sound has come into my art territory .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there . I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
At that time , sound was trending , and this struck me ... there was no visual art , everything was auditory . During this summer , I visited different museums and gallery spaces , and as I went from one place to the next , I noticed there was no visual art there . Prior to this time , I had been working as a painter .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin , Germany , for an artist residency there .
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice . And everything that I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to do away with and unlearn . I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears . So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .

And when I presented this to the art community , I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received . So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .

So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice . And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork , or it could empower me . I actually know sound .
And everything that I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to do away with and unlearn . I realized : sound is like money , power , control -- social currency . So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice .

I chose to be empowered . In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing . And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .


And sound is so powerful that it could either disempower me and my artwork , or it could empower me . So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice . And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .

So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different ASL interpreters . There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language . In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
And their voice becomes my voice and identity . And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all . I chose to be empowered .

So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice . And just because I don &apos;t use my literal voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all . There &apos;s a massive culture around spoken language .

And their voices hold value and currency . So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice . So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different ASL interpreters .

And their voice becomes my voice and identity . So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music . And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL .
So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL . I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works .

So with sound as my new art medium , I delved into the world of music . And the same holds true for a concept in ASL . Ironically , by borrowing out their voices , I &apos;m able to maintain a temporary form of currency , kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate .

If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano -- such as facial expression , body movement , speed , hand shape and so on , as you play the piano -- English is a linear language , as if one key is being pressed at a time . If I didn &apos;t continue this practice , I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency . ASL is broken down into many different grammatical parameters .

For example , a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper . And the same holds true for a concept in ASL .
And the same holds true for a concept in ASL . I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works .
In ASL , by playing around with these different grammatical parameters , you can express different ideas .











For example , this is the sign for &quot; day , &quot; as the sun rises and sets . This is &quot; all day . &quot; If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
If I was to repeat it and slow it down , visually it looks like a piece of music . If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
If I was to repeat it and slow it down , visually it looks like a piece of music . I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens ? &quot;


If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music . For example , this is the sign for &quot; day , &quot; as the sun rises and sets .

This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .


Then &quot; past , &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot;

Then &quot; past , &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot; For example , 1H is one hand , 2H is two hand , present tense happens closest and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back . And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; overnight , &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot;
This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .

Yet when I see the word &quot; common time , &quot; what automatically comes to mind for me is &quot; at the same time . &quot;
Yet when I see the word &quot; common time , &quot; what automatically comes to mind for me is &quot; at the same time . &quot; I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two .
&quot; Common time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure .

Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the chest , kind of like &quot; common time &quot; or at the same time . Yes , got it . Everybody , hands up .
&quot; Common time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time signature of four beats per measure . Then &quot; past , &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot; We have the staff across the head and the chest .

We have the staff across the head and the chest . So notice RH : right hand , LH : left hand . I &apos;m now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the &quot; flash claw . &quot;




Now the third -- please follow along again . And again . Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the chest , kind of like &quot; common time &quot; or at the same time .


The second one I &apos;d like to demonstrate is this -- please follow along with me again . So let &apos;s do all three together . And again .


Now the third -- please follow along again . So it &apos;s amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving , just like music is . However , in this day and age , we live in a very audio-centric world .




And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be deaf to learn ASL , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music . And just because ASL has no sound to it , it automatically holds no social currency . So it &apos;s amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving , just like music is .
We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency -- without sound . And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language . &quot; Fall in love , &quot; &quot; colonization &quot; and &quot; enlightenment . &quot;

And that &apos;s probably the reason why I &apos;ve chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon .
So I &apos;m a neurosurgeon . And that &apos;s probably the reason why I &apos;ve chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon .



What is a functional neurosurgeon ? It &apos;s a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies . And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body , the brain has very little ability for self-repair .
And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain . And that &apos;s probably the reason why I &apos;ve chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon . However , neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair .
You &apos;ve certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation , where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function .

You &apos;ve certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation , where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function . And I would like to show you that we are very close to this . It &apos;s a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies .

And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain . And I would like to show you that we are very close to this . You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he &apos;s increasing his intracranial pressure .
And I would like to show you that we are very close to this .
At that time , I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room .
And in order to save his life , you have to decrease this intracranial pressure .
You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he &apos;s increasing his intracranial pressure . We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue . So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain , we decided with Jean-François Brunet , who is a colleague of mine , a biologist , to study them .
So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain , we decided with Jean-François Brunet , who is a colleague of mine , a biologist , to study them . I often had to take care of patients with head trauma . You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he &apos;s increasing his intracranial pressure .
you sometimes have to remove a piece of swollen brain . You have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he &apos;s increasing his intracranial pressure . Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family .

Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family . So you need to find the right nutrients , the warmth , the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive .


Growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family . So that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
And after many attempts , Jean-François did it . We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue .


The adult brain has stem cells , but they &apos;re very rare and they &apos;re located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain . So it was surprising to get this kind of stem cell culture from the superficial part of swollen brain we had in the operating theater . And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells , able to turn into any type of cell of the body .


Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture , with large green cells surrounding small , immature cells .





And there was another intriguing observation : Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide , divide , divide very quickly . But these cells behave differently . The adult brain has stem cells , but they &apos;re very rare and they &apos;re located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain .
And they never die , they &apos;re immortal cells . And there was another intriguing observation : Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide , divide , divide very quickly . And it took us a long time to understand where they came from .


When you were fetuses , they helped your brain to fold itself . They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells . All of you have them in your brain .

But why do they stay in your head ? They have a very important role during the development stage .

They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells . We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions . These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells .



We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions . But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells , we got our stem cell culture . This , we don &apos;t know .
But it &apos;s not so sure . But why do they stay in your head ? This , we don &apos;t know .
We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions .
But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells , we got our stem cell culture . And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain . We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions .
And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain . We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions . The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain in a non-eloquent area of the brain , and then to culture the cells exactly the way Jean-François did it in his lab .
But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells , we got our stem cell culture .





In the second-case scenario , we performed the lesion , we re-implanted exactly the same cells , and in this case , the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons . So the first question we had , &quot; What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain , and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain ? &quot;
So in the first-case scenario , we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .



So in the first-case scenario , we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear . In the second-case scenario , we performed the lesion , we re-implanted exactly the same cells , and in this case , the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons .

And the proof they carry , these little spots , those are the cells that we &apos;ve labeled in vitro , when they were in culture . So the monkeys were plegic , they could not move their hand anymore . And when they had reached a plateau of performance , we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion .
So for that , we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task . So the monkeys were plegic , they could not move their hand anymore . And when they had reached a plateau of performance , we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion .

Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion ? Patients are completely plegic , and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism , they recover to a certain extent , exactly the same for the monkey . So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery , we implanted his own cells .
Patients are completely plegic , and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism , they recover to a certain extent , exactly the same for the monkey .
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery , we implanted his own cells . So on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .
So the monkeys were plegic , they could not move their hand anymore .
And exactly the same as humans would do , they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent , exactly the same as after a stroke . So on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered . And look now , when we re-impant the cells : Two months after re-implantation , the same individual .

And exactly the same as humans would do , they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent , exactly the same as after a stroke . Patients are completely plegic , and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism , they recover to a certain extent , exactly the same for the monkey . He &apos;s at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
So when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery , we implanted his own cells .
We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models , like Parkinson &apos;s disease , for example . Since that time , we &apos;ve understood much more about these cells . So on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .


We know that we can cryopreserve them , we can use them later on . It was also very exciting results for us , I tell you . And look now , when we re-impant the cells : Two months after re-implantation , the same individual .





But our dream is still to implant them in humans . And I really hope that I &apos;ll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself .
And of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ?
JB : Yes , it is , but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it , you know ? And of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ? Bruno Giussani : Jocelyne , this is amazing , and I &apos;m sure that right now , there are several dozen people in the audience , possibly even a majority , who are thinking , &quot; I know somebody who can use this . &quot;

And of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ? It depends , first , on the approval of the trial . Jocelyne Bloch : The biggest obstacles are regulations . So , from these exciting results , you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials .
Jocelyne Bloch : The biggest obstacles are regulations . So , from these exciting results , you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials . And then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients .
So it takes , already , a long time to select the patients , do the treatment and evaluate if it &apos;s useful to do this kind of treatment . And then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients . And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial .

You have to really prove first that it &apos;s useful before offering this treatment up for everybody . And then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients .

So it takes , already , a long time to select the patients , do the treatment and evaluate if it &apos;s useful to do this kind of treatment . It depends , first , on the approval of the trial . Will the regulation allow us to do it soon ?

In the West , we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted . We see democracy not as the most fragile of flowers that it really is , but we see it as part of our society &apos;s furniture . We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy .
In the West , we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted . It doesn &apos;t . We tend to think of it as an intransigent given .




Singapore &apos;s Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing that it is perfectly possible to have a flourishing capitalism , spectacular growth , while politics remains democracy-free .
I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew , the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic , boisterous democracy .
Tonight , here , I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy .
Speaking of waste , allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak . I want to ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew , the Chinese Communist Party and indeed the Eurogroup are wrong in believing that we can dispense with democracy -- that we need an authentic , boisterous democracy .

Speaking of waste , allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak . But few people discern its twin .



The result is stagnant wages , more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America , in Japan and in Europe And consequently , low aggregate demand , which in a never-ending cycle , reinforces the pessimism of the investors , who , fearing low demand , reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus &apos; father , who , terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him , So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks , failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets . $ 3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $ 5.1 trillion that has been slushing around in the same countries , in our financial institutions , doing absolutely nothing during the same period except inflating stock exchanges and bidding up house prices .


Over the last three months , in the United States , in Britain and in the Eurozone , we have invested , collectively , 3.4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants , machinery , office blocks , schools , roads , railways , machinery , and so on and so forth .

unwittingly engineered the conditions that ensured that Oedipus , his son , would kill him .

This is my quarrel with capitalism .

Now , of course Athenian democracy excluded too many . Women , migrants and , of course , the slaves . This is my quarrel with capitalism .

Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer ? What was more pertinent , and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy , was the inclusion of the working poor , who not only acquired the right to free speech , but more importantly , crucially , they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state . But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded .
Women , migrants and , of course , the slaves .

But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded . Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor , our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition , which was , after all , a charter for masters . And indeed , our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens .
Now , of course Athenian democracy excluded too many .

And indeed , liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere , so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere , leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world , if you want -- as a democracy-free zone . But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded .

If you think about it , it is a little bit like a population of predators , that are so successful in decimating the prey that they must feed on , that in the end they starve . I spoke about my quarrel with capitalism . It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere , which is separate .
It &apos;s not because their DNA has degenerated . It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power , because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere , which is separate . Similarly , the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself , Corporate power is increasing , political goods are devaluing , inequality is rising , aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations .




Clearly , if this is right , we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control , like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants . The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered , as they were in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brutality and waste .

So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy , the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity &apos;s wealth . The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate , automation makes the twin peaks taller , the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper , including -- soon , I believe -- in places like China .
Capitalism &apos;s doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata , androids , robots . The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered , as they were in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brutality and waste . So we need to reconfigure , we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres , but we &apos;d better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere , lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix , the movie , look like a documentary .
But there is a solution : eliminate the working poor . Capitalism &apos;s doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata , androids , robots .

But what would it take , what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia , instead of the Matrix-like dystopia ?
But what would it take , what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia , instead of the Matrix-like dystopia ? So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning . No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company ; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor ; no great gap between investment and saving ; indeed , no towering twin peaks .
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning . In practical terms , allow me to share just briefly , a couple of examples . I think we can afford to be optimistic .
The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society , where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient , Athenian-like , high tech agora .
And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce .

It &apos;s what , effectively , John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference . Now we do , especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere . Then all income stems from capital , from profits , and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete .
At the level of the global political economy , imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate , with a universal , global , digital currency , one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund , on behalf of all humanity . And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let &apos;s call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country &apos;s trade deficit , or indeed to a country &apos;s trade surplus . And imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funding is scarce .
It &apos;s what , effectively , John Maynard Keynes proposed in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference . This is not a new idea . At the level of the global political economy , imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate , with a universal , global , digital currency , one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund , on behalf of all humanity .
The problem is that back then , they didn &apos;t have the technology to implement it .




It is our choice , and we &apos;d better make it democratically . Now we do , especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere . But above all else , it is a world in which we will be able to imagine an authentic democracy .
The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively . The world that I am describing to you is simultaneously libertarian , in that it prioritizes empowered individuals , Marxist , since it will have confined to the dustbin of history the division between capital and labor , and Keynesian , global Keynesian . Yanis Varoufakis : Well , if there was any relevance in what I just said , then Marx is relevant .




So if this analysis holds water , then Marx is absolutely relevant . But so is Hayek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a libertarian Marxist , and so is Keynes , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally confused .

BG : That &apos;s a very , very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say -- YV : That was Einstein , actually -- BG : During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China , and last night at the speaker dinner , you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China . So if this analysis holds water , then Marx is absolutely relevant . BG : Indeed , and possibly we are too , now .
Yanis Varoufakis : Well , if there was any relevance in what I just said , then Marx is relevant . What is the relevance of Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
YV : If you are not confused , you are not thinking , OK ? So if this analysis holds water , then Marx is absolutely relevant .
With this crisis migrating from one part of the world , as it is now , it will destabilize not only our democracies , but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy .
But so is Hayek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a libertarian Marxist , and so is Keynes , so that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally confused . BG : That &apos;s a very , very Greek philosopher kind of thing to say -- YV : That was Einstein , actually -- BG : During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China , and last night at the speaker dinner , you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China .

BG : Indeed , and possibly we are too , now . In our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy .
It &apos;s because we have confined , as I was saying in my talk , democracy to the political sphere , while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone .
Because remember , we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically .
So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .

Would you like to share that ?
So what you are seeing now in China is a very similar process to the one that we had in Britain during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . BG : I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year . In our liberal democracies , we have a semblance of democracy .







And , unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , in the Eurogroup , chose to maintain denial . And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century , smacks of hypocrisy .

BG : Yes . And , unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , in the Eurogroup , chose to maintain denial . YV : Extremely exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone .
Not just Greece , the Eurozone . And , unfortunately , the powers in the Eurozone , in the Eurogroup , chose to maintain denial . YV : Extremely exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone .
YV : Extremely exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone . We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right . To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone , which is threatening , massively , the whole of the European Union process .











And there wasn &apos;t . BG : For example ? YV : Anybody who looks back -- No , but seriously . And because they didn &apos;t want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece .

And there wasn &apos;t .
And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say , &quot; This was a colossal mistake . &quot; I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground . The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February .
And no one has come clean from the troika of lenders that have been imposing this policy to say , &quot; This was a colossal mistake . &quot; This is worse than the Great Depression . BG : Despite all this , and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion , you seem to be remaining quite pro-European .


Look , my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe . They were simply interested in crushing our government , just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone . And because they didn &apos;t want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece .
We are probably the largest economy in the world . BG : Despite all this , and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion , you seem to be remaining quite pro-European . And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy .
YV : Absolutely . And if we allow ourselves to fall into a route of the postmodern 1930 &apos;s , which seems to me to be what we are doing , then that will be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans alike . BG : Despite all this , and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion , you seem to be remaining quite pro-European .



And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy .




He may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not very many of you .
Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about , even though he may have been responsible for 22 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . And Roy Price has a very responsible job , because it &apos;s his responsibility to pick the shows , the original content that Amazon is going to make . That &apos;s the TV production company of Amazon .




I mean , there are so many TV shows already out there , that Roy can &apos;t just choose any show . He has to find shows that are really , really great .
So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher , that &apos;s a winner . So you see , Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios . And Roy Price has a very responsible job , because it &apos;s his responsibility to pick the shows , the original content that Amazon is going to make .

So in other words , he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here . I mean , there are so many TV shows already out there , that Roy can &apos;t just choose any show . And Roy Price has a very responsible job , because it &apos;s his responsibility to pick the shows , the original content that Amazon is going to make .
And of course that &apos;s a highly competitive space . He has to find shows that are really , really great .
That &apos;s shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thrones , &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; so all of these shows that are addictive , whereafter you &apos;ve watched a season , your brain is basically like , &quot; Where can I get more of these episodes ? &quot; And Roy Price has a very responsible job , because it &apos;s his responsibility to pick the shows , the original content that Amazon is going to make . And of course that &apos;s a highly competitive space .

So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher , that &apos;s a winner . So this curve here is the rating distribution of about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB , and the rating goes from one to 10 , and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating . So what he &apos;s worried about is this middle bulge here , the bulge of average TV , you know , those shows that aren &apos;t really good or really bad , they don &apos;t really get you excited .
So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher , that &apos;s a winner . Then you have a top two percent show .

Now , Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve , because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut &quot; Toddlers and Tiaras . &quot;
On the left side , just for clarity , here on that end , you have a show called &quot; Toddlers and Tiaras &quot; -- -- which should tell you enough about what &apos;s going on on that end of the curve . So what he &apos;s worried about is this middle bulge here , the bulge of average TV , you know , those shows that aren &apos;t really good or really bad , they don &apos;t really get you excited . So he needs to make sure that he &apos;s really on the right end of this .
Now , Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve , because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut &quot; Toddlers and Tiaras . &quot; So he needs to make sure that he &apos;s really on the right end of this . So the pressure is on , and of course it &apos;s also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this , so Roy Price does not want to take any chances .

So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows , and from those ideas , through an evaluation , they select eight candidates for TV shows , and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch . He needs a guaranteed success , and so what he does is , he holds a competition . So millions of viewers are watching those episodes .

He wants to engineer success .




They record when somebody presses play , when somebody presses pause , what parts they skip , what parts they watch again . So they collect millions of data points , because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make . And sure enough , so they collect all the data , they do all the data crunching , and an answer emerges , and the answer is , &quot; Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators . &quot;
They are being watched by Roy Price and his team , who record everything . So they collect millions of data points , because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make . Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it didn &apos;t turn out that great .
It &apos;s actually just an average show , actually -- literally , in fact , because the average of this curve here is at 7.4 , and &quot; Alpha House &quot; lands at 7.5 , so a slightly above average show , but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for . What they don &apos;t realize is that , while they &apos;re watching their shows , actually , they are being watched . So millions of viewers are watching those episodes .


Yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show , actually , because it didn &apos;t turn out that great .





Meanwhile , however , at about the same time , at another company , another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis , and his name is Ted , Ted Sarandos , who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix , and just like Roy , he &apos;s on a constant mission to find that great TV show , and he uses data as well to do that , except he does it a little bit differently . So you have two very competitive , data-savvy companies . Yes , &quot; House of Cards , &quot; and Netflix of course , nailed it with that show , at least for the first two seasons .
They connect all of these millions of data points , and then it works beautifully for one of them , and it doesn &apos;t work for the other one . And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience : what kinds of shows they like , what kind of producers , what kind of actors . Yes , &quot; House of Cards , &quot; and Netflix of course , nailed it with that show , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it &apos;s exactly where they wanted it to be . Meanwhile , however , at about the same time , at another company , another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis , and his name is Ted , Ted Sarandos , who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix , and just like Roy , he &apos;s on a constant mission to find that great TV show , and he uses data as well to do that , except he does it a little bit differently . And once they had all of these pieces together , they took a leap of faith , and they decided to license not a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a single Senator .
And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience : what kinds of shows they like , what kind of producers , what kind of actors . So instead of holding a competition , what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers , you know , the ratings they give their shows , the viewing histories , what shows people like , and so on .
Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time . I mean , if you &apos;re collecting millions of data points on a decision you &apos;re going to make , then you should be able to make a pretty good decision . &quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve , so it &apos;s exactly where they wanted it to be .





And if data analysis does not work that way , then it actually gets a little scary , because we live in a time where we &apos;re turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV .



If someone here in the US is in prison , and they apply for parole , then it &apos;s very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole . OK , so Multi-Health Systems is a software company , and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software , because if you do , it means you &apos;re in prison .


OK , so Multi-Health Systems is a software company , and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software , because if you do , it means you &apos;re in prison . Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems ? And if data analysis does not work that way , then it actually gets a little scary , because we live in a time where we &apos;re turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond TV .
And that &apos;s not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn &apos;t know what to do with data . Yes , even Google gets it wrong sometimes .
So it &apos;s the same principle as Amazon and Netflix , but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad , you &apos;re deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad .
If someone here in the US is in prison , and they apply for parole , then it &apos;s very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole . OK , so Multi-Health Systems is a software company , and I hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software , because if you do , it means you &apos;re in prison .



And mediocre TV , 22 minutes , that can be pretty bad , but more years in prison , I guess , even worse . And that &apos;s not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn &apos;t know what to do with data . It just didn &apos;t work that year , and of course that again made big news , of a publication from the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
It worked beautifully for year after year after year , until one year it failed . And that &apos;s not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn &apos;t know what to do with data . And unfortunately , there is actually some evidence that this data analysis , despite having lots of data , does not always produce optimum results .
And it worked beautifully , and it made a big splash in the news , including the pinnacle of scientific success : a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot; So even the most data-savvy companies , Amazon and Google , they sometimes get it wrong . Yes , even Google gets it wrong sometimes .
In 2009 , Google announced that they were able , with data analysis , to predict outbreaks of influenza , the nasty kind of flu , by doing data analysis on their Google searches . It just didn &apos;t work that year , and of course that again made big news , of a publication from the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
And over the years , I &apos;ve noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule , if you will , about the difference between successful decision-making with data and unsuccessful decision-making , and I find this a pattern worth sharing , and it goes something like this . So even the most data-savvy companies , Amazon and Google , they sometimes get it wrong . Now , personally I &apos;ve seen a lot of this struggle with data myself , because I work in computational genetics , which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug .


And despite all those failures , data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making -- into the workplace , law enforcement , medicine . Now , personally I &apos;ve seen a lot of this struggle with data myself , because I work in computational genetics , which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug . And over the years , I &apos;ve noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule , if you will , about the difference between successful decision-making with data and unsuccessful decision-making , and I find this a pattern worth sharing , and it goes something like this .


Data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces . The first one is , you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces , You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion . It &apos;s not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion .
So whenever you &apos;re solving a complex problem , you &apos;re doing essentially two things . And over the years , I &apos;ve noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule , if you will , about the difference between successful decision-making with data and unsuccessful decision-making , and I find this a pattern worth sharing , and it goes something like this .



The first one is , you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces , You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion . And now the crucial thing is that data and data analysis is only good for the first part . So whenever you &apos;re solving a complex problem , you &apos;re doing essentially two things .


They used data all the way to drive their decision-making , first when they held their competition of TV ideas , then when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; to make as a show . They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to understand at that depth , but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was nowhere in the data . Data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces .
It &apos;s not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion .
And Amazon , on the other hand , they did it the wrong way around . And that &apos;s why I believe that Netflix was so successful , because they used data and brains where they belong in the process .


They used data all the way to drive their decision-making , first when they held their competition of TV ideas , then when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; to make as a show .
So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions . No matter how powerful , data is just a tool , and to keep that in mind , I find this device here quite useful .
They used data all the way to drive their decision-making , first when they held their competition of TV ideas , then when they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; to make as a show . Which of course was a very safe decision for them , because they could always point at the data , saying , &quot; This is what the data tells us . &quot;



So data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions , but I believe that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions .
No matter how powerful , data is just a tool , and to keep that in mind , I find this device here quite useful . So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter , but I believe it &apos;s still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary , on the right end of the curve .

So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter , but I believe it &apos;s still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary , on the right end of the curve . This toy here is called the Magic 8 Ball , and it &apos;s really amazing , because if you have a decision to make , a yes or no question , all you have to do is you shake the ball , and then you get an answer -- &quot; Most Likely &quot; -- right here in this window in real time .


Because in the end , it &apos;s not data , it &apos;s risks that will land you on the right end of the curve .

So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter , but I believe it &apos;s still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary , on the right end of the curve . And I find that a very encouraging message , in fact , that even in the face of huge amounts of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you &apos;re doing and take risks .


So I grew up in a bubble of innocence -- or a bubble of ignorance , I should say , because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth . Fast forward , I am an adult now , and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School .







And so it &apos;s sad to say , but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them . And growing up , I found out that adults make a mess , and they &apos;re not very good at cleaning up after themselves .
And so it &apos;s sad to say , but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them . And it doesn &apos;t take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash .

And in past decades , we &apos;ve been taking those big ships out and those big nets , and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope , and we sort them , and then we put this data onto a map . But that takes forever , it &apos;s very expensive , and so it &apos;s quite risky to take those big boats out . And so we started building this small workbench , with different heights , so even really short kids can participate .


And so we started building this small workbench , with different heights , so even really short kids can participate . So with my students , ages six to 15 , we &apos;ve been dreaming of inventing a better way . So we &apos;ve transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop .







I let the imaginations of my students run wild . So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor , and the computer on board will process this image , and measure the size of each particle , so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water .
And we hack table lamps and webcams , into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there -- and this is the image that we get in the robot .
And the next thing we do -- we do what we call &quot; rapid prototyping . &quot;
We are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we &apos;re hacking it . So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor , and the computer on board will process this image , and measure the size of each particle , so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water .




But , there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s rather simple , that &apos;s called spectrometry , that allows you see what &apos;s in the water . And also you can see the water is brown , the mud is brown and oil is brown , so when everything is mixed up , it &apos;s really hard to see what &apos;s in the water . So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer , and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums , so that can help you identify what &apos;s in the water .

And they watch the news , they watch the Internet , and they came across this image .
So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments , and I wanted to take it even further -- maybe addressing an even harder problem , and it &apos;s also closer to my heart . But , there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s rather simple , that &apos;s called spectrometry , that allows you see what &apos;s in the water . So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer , and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums , so that can help you identify what &apos;s in the water .
So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer , and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums , so that can help you identify what &apos;s in the water . So what was cool about this project was that beyond addressing a local problem , or looking at a local problem , my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help , remotely , other kids . So they were very shocked , because this is the water they drink , this is the water they bathe in , this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live .

It was so violent that it triggered several giant waves -- they are called tsunami -- and those tsunami destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan . So I &apos;m half Japanese and half French , and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan . And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137 .

And today , I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean . So I &apos;ve been going to Fukushima every year since the accident , and I measure independently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids . Also , it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima , the nuclear power plant just by the water .

So I &apos;ve been going to Fukushima every year since the accident , and I measure independently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids .


So of course we didn &apos;t take the kids , the parents wouldn &apos;t allow that to happen .
And so we built the elevation map , we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity , and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall . And so what we did with them is that we &apos;d discuss the data we collected that day , and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy , itinerary , etc ... So I &apos;ve been going to Fukushima every year since the accident , and I measure independently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids .

But with this in mind , we organized this expedition , which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant . And to do this , we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant . It could look like they didn &apos;t take the work seriously , but they really did because they &apos;re going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life .
And so what we did with them is that we &apos;d discuss the data we collected that day , and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy , itinerary , etc ... And so we built the elevation map , we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity , and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall . And to do this , we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear power plant .





We pack the sediment into small bags , we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities , and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity , especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce , and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi . We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant , and with the help of the local fisherman , we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we &apos;ve invented and built . You can see a progression here -- we &apos;ve gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem .



And its a place where adults and kids can play together .

So plastic , oil and radioactivity are horrible , horrible legacies , but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies .

We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions .




So plastic , oil and radioactivity are horrible , horrible legacies , but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies . Thank you . We &apos;re asking questions such as , can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy ?


One is imposed on the environment , the other creates it . One is synthetic , the other organic . Two twin domes , two radically opposed design cultures .
One is made of thousands of steel parts , the other of a single silk thread . Two twin domes , two radically opposed design cultures . One is designed for nature , the other is designed by her .
One is synthetic , the other organic .

The chisel was Michelangelo &apos;s only tool . Two twin domes , two radically opposed design cultures . But living things are not chiseled .

One is designed for nature , the other is designed by her . The chisel was Michelangelo &apos;s only tool . And in our smallest units of life , our cells , we carry all the information that &apos;s required for every other cell to function and to replicate .
But living things are not chiseled . Tools also have consequences . And in our smallest units of life , our cells , we carry all the information that &apos;s required for every other cell to function and to replicate .

Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts , framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions . Take human skin , for example . At least since the Industrial Revolution , the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production .

At least since the Industrial Revolution , the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production .

Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts , framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions . One acts mainly as filter , the other mainly as barrier , and yet it &apos;s the same skin : no parts , no assemblies . And in our smallest units of life , our cells , we carry all the information that &apos;s required for every other cell to function and to replicate .
One acts mainly as filter , the other mainly as barrier , and yet it &apos;s the same skin : no parts , no assemblies .


But you don &apos;t find homogenous material assemblies in nature . Take human skin , for example .
These two worldviews , my left brain and right brain , analysis and synthesis , will play out on the two screens behind me . One acts mainly as filter , the other mainly as barrier , and yet it &apos;s the same skin : no parts , no assemblies .


Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago ? We live in a very special time in history , a rare time , a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we &apos;ve never had access to before .
My work , at its simplest level , is about uniting these two worldviews , moving away from assembly and closer into growth . These two worldviews , my left brain and right brain , analysis and synthesis , will play out on the two screens behind me . So here this is a split screen to represent my split world view , the split personality of every designer and architect operating today between the chisel and the gene , between machine and organism , between assembly and growth , between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin .


We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales , from the large-scale , like this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings , to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark . In our next project , we explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt -- this was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen -- like a second skin that are made of a single part , stiff at the contours , flexible around the waist . Here we &apos;ve reimagined the mashrabiya , an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture , and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it .

This helmet combines stiff and soft materials in 20-micron resolution .



Its surface , as in nature , varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly , but by continuously and delicately varying material property . We printed its surface out of 44 different properties , varying in rigidity , opacity and color , corresponding to pressure points on the human body . But is nature ideal ?

Next , we designed an acoustic chair , a chair that would be at once structural , comfortable and would also absorb sound . This is the resolution of a human hair . It &apos;s also the resolution of a CT scanner .
I wasn &apos;t raised in a religious Jewish home , but when I was young , my grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible , and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about . Next , we designed an acoustic chair , a chair that would be at once structural , comfortable and would also absorb sound . That designers have access to such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools , enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies , but also the physiological makeup of our tissues .



Instead , the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers .
The whole tree was a fruit . The land created a world made of parts . Instead , the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers .
The land created a world made of parts .

Instead , the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers . As she recounts : &quot; On the third day of Creation , God commands the Earth to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree . &quot; For this first fruit tree , there was to be no differentiation between trunk , branches , leaves and fruit .

The land created a world made of parts .
Would we return to a better state of creation ? &quot;
We thought if we could tune its properties , we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part . We called Legal Seafood -- we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells , we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste . So we looked for that biblical material , that fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material , and we found it .
By varying chemical concentrations , we were able to achieve a wide array of properties -- from dark , stiff and opaque , to light , soft and transparent . The robot would vary material properties on the fly and create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material , 100 percent recyclable .

So that &apos;s what we did .
So why are we still designing with plastics ?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago , as we learned yesterday .
By varying chemical concentrations , we were able to achieve a wide array of properties -- from dark , stiff and opaque , to light , soft and transparent . In order to print the structures in large scale , we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles .

So like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented . The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago , as we learned yesterday . Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT , we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar .
For the first time , we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam to mesh , and if scaled even larger , to windows .
So like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented . Working with an ancient material , one of the first lifeforms on the planet , plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology , we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves like a tree . We looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing for interplanetary voyages .

We looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing for interplanetary voyages . The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system .
I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy , only instead of transmuting precious metals , you &apos;re synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels . And here &apos;s the best part : for objects designed to biodegrade , put them in the sea , and they will nourish marine life ; place them in soil , and they will help grow a tree . In our first piece of clothing , we combined two microorganisms .


And the second , E. coli , the bacterium that inhabits the human gut . In our first piece of clothing , we combined two microorganisms . To do that , we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow .
It &apos;s called microfluidics . We 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures . So like the periodic table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new lifeforms that were computationally grown , additively manufactured and biologically augmented .
And the second , E. coli , the bacterium that inhabits the human gut . In our first piece of clothing , we combined two microorganisms . One converts light into sugar , the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment .

The first is cyanobacteria . Now , these two microorganisms never interact in nature . One converts light into sugar , the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment .

In fact , they never met each other .

We then started growing these channels on the human body , varying material properties according to the desired functionality . In order to contain these relationships , we &apos;ve created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract , that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way . Now , these two microorganisms never interact in nature .

And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED -- our first photosynthetic wearable , liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing .

This is half the length of a football field , and 10 times as long as our small intestines . And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED -- our first photosynthetic wearable , liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing .

Where we wanted more photosynthesis , we would design more transparent channels . This wearable digestive system , when it &apos;s stretched end to end , spans 60 meters . We then started growing these channels on the human body , varying material properties according to the desired functionality .


And here it is for the first time unveiled at TED -- our first photosynthetic wearable , liquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing . This entire collection , Wanderers , that was named after planets , was not to me really about fashion per se , but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond , to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies , the microorganisms that we inhabit , our products and even our buildings .

Mary Shelley said , &quot; We are unfashioned creatures , but only half made up . &quot; Thank you . By now , you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers . You also know that nature doesn &apos;t .


This silkworm cocoon , for example , creates a highly sophisticated architecture , a home inside which to metamorphisize . I call this material ecology . It grows . It adds with sophistication .

By now , you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers . You also know that nature doesn &apos;t .
It grows . It adds with sophistication . No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication .
It does so by combining not two materials , but two proteins in different concentrations . By now , you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers . You also know that nature doesn &apos;t .



However , when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch , not inside a box , we realized it would spin a flat cocoon and it would still healthily metamorphisize .

It does so by combining not two materials , but two proteins in different concentrations . We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors , and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon .
In order to better understand how this complex process works , we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm , to the spinneret .
The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment -- it creates a tensile structure -- and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon . We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon .

We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon .
Silkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons , their silk unraveled and used in the textile industry .

We had a robot spin the template out of silk , and we placed it on our site . We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon . We then created holes , or apertures , that would lock in the rays of light and heat , distributing those silkworms on the structure .


We knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas , so we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat on our structure . We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon . We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold , and as they spin they pupate , they mate , they lay eggs , and life begins all over again -- just like us but much , much shorter .

We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold , and as they spin they pupate , they mate , they lay eggs , and life begins all over again -- just like us but much , much shorter . As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk , they give this entire pavilion its integrity . We ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm .
And after four weeks of feeding , they were ready to spin with us . And over two to three weeks , 6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers . As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk , they give this entire pavilion its integrity .

And over two to three weeks , 6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers . Here &apos;s to a new age of design , a new age of creation , that takes us from a nature-inspired design to a design-inspired nature , and that demands of us for the first time that we mother nature . If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us , to form a two-material ecology , then designers must unite these two worldviews . Which brings us back , of course , to the beginning .





Any anxiety at all .




Three . Five . Three . Five . Five . OK .


But then I would become interested in something else , something totally unrelated , and I would dive into that , and become all-consumed , and I &apos;d be like , &quot; Yes ! I found my thing , &quot; and then I would hit this point again where I &apos;d start to get bored . But eventually this sense of boredom , this feeling of , like , yeah , I got this , this isn &apos;t challenging anymore -- it would get to be too much . And eventually , I would let it go .
This continued after high school , and at a certain point , I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in , become all-consumed , and I &apos;d get to be pretty good at whatever it was , and then I would hit this point where I &apos;d start to get bored .

This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons . The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal . If you can relate to my story and to these feelings , I &apos;d like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then .
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
The first was that I wasn &apos;t sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career . I worried that I was afraid of commitment , or that I was scattered , or that I was self-sabotaging , afraid of my own success . This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety , for two reasons .
I worried that I was afraid of commitment , or that I was scattered , or that I was self-sabotaging , afraid of my own success . I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing , deny all of my other passions , and just resign myself to being bored . The first was that I wasn &apos;t sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career .
I worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything .

I &apos;ll tell you where you learned it : you learned it from the culture .

But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms -- for instance , high school students might get asked what major they &apos;re going to pick in college . And at some point , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night .


In fact , it does just the opposite , because when someone asks you what you want to be , you can &apos;t reply with 20 different things , though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like , &quot; Oh , how cute , but you can &apos;t be a violin maker and a psychologist . But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms -- for instance , high school students might get asked what major they &apos;re going to pick in college . And at some point , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night .

It &apos;s considered an innocuous question , posed to little kids to elicit cute replies , like , &quot; I want to be an astronaut , &quot; or &quot; I want to be a ballerina , &quot; or &quot; I want to be a pirate . &quot;

And at some point , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night .

Why ?
See , while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be , it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be . And at some point , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot; goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night .
All they hear is that they &apos;re going to have to choose .

All they hear is that they &apos;re going to have to choose . The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture . It &apos;s this idea of destiny or the one true calling , the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth , and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it .

It &apos;s easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome . Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry .

Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite , but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences . Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography , data visualization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded Meshu . But what I &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way .

Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography , data visualization , travel , mathematics and design , when they founded Meshu . And multipotentialites , with all of their backgrounds , are able to access a lot of these points of intersection .

He &apos;s even more valuable because he can take on various roles , depending on his clients &apos; needs . Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the 21st century . The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive .

In fact , some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together .


The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas , while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project .



So with that said , if there is one thing you take away from this talk , I hope that it is this : embrace your inner wiring , whatever that may be . But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we &apos;re wired . You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon .

Her doctor was called Alois .
After she died , Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste &apos;s brain -- the likes of which he &apos;d never seen before . Now here &apos;s the even more striking thing . Her doctor was called Alois .
In the year 1901 , a woman called Auguste was taken to a medical asylum in Frankfurt . Alois didn &apos;t know how to help Auguste , but he watched over her until , sadly , she passed away in 1906 . If Auguste had instead been alive today , we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago .







But we &apos;ve made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer &apos;s disease .



I &apos;m part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer &apos;s for over a decade . But by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people -- which , by the way , will include many of you . But we &apos;ve made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer &apos;s disease .

It is today the most expensive disease , and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050 , as the baby boomer generation ages . In other words , odds are you &apos;ll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer &apos;s . Today , of the top 10 causes of death worldwide , Alzheimer &apos;s is the only one we cannot prevent , cure or even slow down .



It may surprise you that , put simply , Alzheimer &apos;s is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation . It is today the most expensive disease , and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050 , as the baby boomer generation ages . The US government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer &apos;s despite the fact that Alzheimer &apos;s costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer .







For most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused Alzheimer &apos;s with aging . We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old .
Because here &apos;s what few people know but everyone should : Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease , and we can cure it . For most of the past 114 years , everyone , including scientists , mistakenly confused Alzheimer &apos;s with aging .

And together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .

There are many steps , and identifying which step to try to block is complex -- like defusing a bomb . And together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .

Let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms . So these are healthy worms , and you can see they &apos;re moving around normally . Now let me show you some of our latest results .
These worms , on the other hand , have protein molecules sticking together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer &apos;s . And together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease . But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage , then we see that they &apos;re healthy , and they live a normal lifespan .

We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it . This is just an initial positive result , but research like this shows us that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease that we can understand and we can cure . After 114 years of waiting , there &apos;s finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years . But to grow that hope , to finally beat Alzheimer &apos;s , we need help .
After 114 years of waiting , there &apos;s finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years . But to grow that hope , to finally beat Alzheimer &apos;s , we need help . But Alzheimer &apos;s patients are often unable to speak up for themselves . And their families , the hidden victims , caring for their loved ones night and day , are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change . In the case of other diseases , patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments , the pharmaceutical industry , scientists and regulators .






But Alzheimer &apos;s patients are often unable to speak up for themselves . And their families , the hidden victims , caring for their loved ones night and day , are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change . Alzheimer &apos;s isn &apos;t , for the most part , a genetic disease . Today , there are 40 million patients like Auguste , who can &apos;t create the change they need for themselves .








So the procedure is fairly simple : two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other &apos;s eyes without speaking for four minutes . Number 30 , I really like this one : Tell your partner what you like about them ; be very honest this time , saying things you might not say to someone you just met . Number 28 : When did you last cry in front of another person ?


And I thought it made a good story , so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later . And when I got the chance to try this study myself , with someone I knew but not particularly well , I wasn &apos;t expecting to fall in love . So when I first came across this study a few years earlier , one detail really stuck out to me , and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later , and they &apos;d invited the entire lab to the ceremony .



I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years , so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog . And I thought it made a good story , so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later . And when I got the chance to try this study myself , with someone I knew but not particularly well , I wasn &apos;t expecting to fall in love .



And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months . And this question is really what I want to talk about today .
So the week before the article came out , I was very nervous .




In fact , as I was preparing this talk , I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase &quot; Are you still together ? &quot; and several messages popped up immediately . Within a month , the article would receive over 8 million views , and I was , to say the least , underprepared for this sort of attention . And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship .



And when people called or emailed , which they did every day for weeks , they always asked the same question first : are you guys still together ? I even gave a talk , and one woman shouted up to the stage , &quot; Hey Mandy , where &apos;s your boyfriend ? &quot;

And when people called or emailed , which they did every day for weeks , they always asked the same question first : are you guys still together ? And I promptly turned bright red .
I did radio interviews and they asked . The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own . And when people called or emailed , which they did every day for weeks , they always asked the same question first : are you guys still together ?

But I just wasn &apos;t prepared for the scope of the response .



And I get it : people didn &apos;t just want to know if the study worked , they wanted to know if it really worked : that is , if it was capable of producing love that would last , not just a fling , but real love , sustainable love .
I said no to every request for the two of us to do a media appearance together .





And I get it : people didn &apos;t just want to know if the study worked , they wanted to know if it really worked : that is , if it was capable of producing love that would last , not just a fling , but real love , sustainable love . Instead , they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students , by using what Aron called &quot; sustained , escalating , reciprocal , personalistic self-disclosure . &quot; What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them ?
I turned down TV interviews , and I said no to every request for photos of the two us . My own relationship was only a few months old , and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place . And I get it : people didn &apos;t just want to know if the study worked , they wanted to know if it really worked : that is , if it was capable of producing love that would last , not just a fling , but real love , sustainable love .

The participants did feel closer after doing it , and several subsequent studies have also used Aron &apos;s fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers . Instead , they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students , by using what Aron called &quot; sustained , escalating , reciprocal , personalistic self-disclosure . &quot;
They &apos;ve used it between members of the police and members of community , and they &apos;ve used it between people of opposing political ideologies . The participants did feel closer after doing it , and several subsequent studies have also used Aron &apos;s fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers . What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them ?

The participants did feel closer after doing it , and several subsequent studies have also used Aron &apos;s fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers . So a few months ago , I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college , and a student came up to me afterwards and he said , kind of shyly , &quot; So , I tried your study , and it didn &apos;t work . &quot; The original version of the story , the one that I tried last summer , that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact , was referenced in this article , but unfortunately it was never published .
Instead , they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students , by using what Aron called &quot; sustained , escalating , reciprocal , personalistic self-disclosure . &quot; Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997 , and here , the researcher &apos;s goal was not to produce romantic love .

The participants did feel closer after doing it , and several subsequent studies have also used Aron &apos;s fast friends protocol as a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers . &quot; You mean , you didn &apos;t fall in love with the person you did it with ? &quot; I asked . So a few months ago , I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts college , and a student came up to me afterwards and he said , kind of shyly , &quot; So , I tried your study , and it didn &apos;t work . &quot;








&quot; But did you become better friends ? &quot; I asked . &quot; Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study ? &quot;







I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love , and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache . So I turned to science . I had been in the relationship since I was 20 , which was basically my entire adult life , and he was my first real love , and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him .


And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways .
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways . I don &apos;t know if I realized this at the time -- I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing -- but it seems really obvious in retrospect . There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved , and this is a very appealing story , because falling in love feels amazing , but it &apos;s also terrifying .
The moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood . I am more patient with love . I am more relaxed . There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved , and this is a very appealing story , because falling in love feels amazing , but it &apos;s also terrifying .
The version of the story that asks , &quot; Are you still together ? &quot; and is content with a yes or no answer . What I want from love is a guarantee , not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow , but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely . The moment you admit to loving someone , you admit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechanism for being known , and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .


So the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love .
What I want from love is a guarantee , not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow , but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely .
Maybe it &apos;s this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together . So , if you want it , the short version of the story of my relationship is this : a year ago , an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love , and we fell in love , and we are still together , and I am so glad . So rather than that question , I would propose we ask some more difficult questions , questions like : How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not ?





How do you stay in love when things get difficult , and how do you know when to just cut and run ?

But falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love . How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship , or even harder , how do you live with your partner &apos;s doubt ? I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions , and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America .



But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone , and the hope that he will choose to love me back , and it is terrifying , but that &apos;s the deal with love . So at the end of my article , I wrote , &quot; Love didn &apos;t happen to us . Falling in love is the easy part .

But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone , and the hope that he will choose to love me back , and it is terrifying , but that &apos;s the deal with love .



And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas , maybe how we ate our spaghetti . I really didn &apos;t know . And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up , and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid , and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck . Now , at some point I was in Hawaii -- I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff , and I was making a collage for my ma .


And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas , maybe how we ate our spaghetti . I really didn &apos;t know . Really messed with my head , but I &apos;ll get into that later .
I &apos;ll start with when I was eight years old . I took a wood box , and I buried a dollar bill , a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado . And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up , and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid , and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck . Instead , the opposite happened : It sort of created a magnification , like a magnifying glass , on the dictionary text .

And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up , and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid , and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck . So I took the objects out , and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens . Now , she &apos;s afraid of bees and she &apos;s allergic to them , so I poured more resin on the canvas , thinking I could hide it or something .
I can make free-floating lines , like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene . So I started drawing around the objects , and I realized : Holy moly , I can draw in space ! So I took the objects out , and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens .



I can make free-floating lines , like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene . This time , I started putting electronics , frogs , strange bottles I &apos;d find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life , and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects . Instead , the opposite happened : It sort of created a magnification , like a magnifying glass , on the dictionary text .

This time , I started putting electronics , frogs , strange bottles I &apos;d find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life , and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects . It was some good shit , man . And it was cool , because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff , I was making some money , I could take my girlfriend for dinner , and like , go to Sizzler .
This was great , except for one thing : I was going to die . And it was cool , because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff , I was making some money , I could take my girlfriend for dinner , and like , go to Sizzler . At some point , I got up to the human form , life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers .








So I tried using glass . I started drawing on the layers of glass , almost like if you drew on a window , then you put another window , and another window , and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition . &quot; The Triptych &quot; was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch &apos;s &quot; The Garden of Earthly Delights , &quot; which is a painting in the Museo del Prado in Spain . Do you guys know this painting ?


So I tried using glass . I started drawing on the layers of glass , almost like if you drew on a window , then you put another window , and another window , and you had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition . And this really worked , because I could stop using the resin .





This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse , and they &apos;re all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean .
This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse , and they &apos;re all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean . Billy Graham is in the ocean ; the Horizon from the oil spill ; Waldo ; Osama Bin Laden &apos;s shelter -- there &apos;s all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard , in the ocean . To the left , you have Jesus and the locusts .
There &apos;s a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds .




That &apos;s her hand that she &apos;s spitting into . And then , when you go to the other side , she has like a trunk , like a bird &apos;s beak , and she &apos;s spitting clouds out of her trunk .


Anyway , this is a lady creature . So that &apos;s one side of &quot; The Triptych . &quot; And then , when you go to the other side , she has like a trunk , like a bird &apos;s beak , and she &apos;s spitting clouds out of her trunk .
She &apos;s coming out of the ocean , and she &apos;s spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand . And then , when you go to the other side , she has like a trunk , like a bird &apos;s beak , and she &apos;s spitting clouds out of her trunk .
That &apos;s her hand that she &apos;s spitting into . She &apos;s coming out of the ocean , and she &apos;s spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand .
So that &apos;s one side of &quot; The Triptych . &quot; And then , when you go to the other side , she has like a trunk , like a bird &apos;s beak , and she &apos;s spitting clouds out of her trunk .
Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent &apos;s tail that connects &quot; The Triptych . &quot; Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball , made out of 1986 terrorist cards . So that &apos;s one side of &quot; The Triptych . &quot;
Anyway , her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano . That happens , you know .
That will bring you to my latest project .
They were made in the 1980 &apos;s , they &apos;re like baseball cards of terrorists . I &apos;m in the middle of two projects : One &apos;s called &quot; Psychogeographies . &quot;



Each one is an archive of our culture , through our ripped-up media and matter , whether it &apos;s encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines . They were made in the 1980 &apos;s , they &apos;re like baseball cards of terrorists .



Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside .


It &apos;s about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans . But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human , and they travel in groups of 20 , 4 , or 12 at a time .
That &apos;s his head ; there &apos;s the chest , you can kind of see the beginning . I &apos;m going to go down the body for you : There &apos;s a waterfall coming out of his chest , covering his penis -- or not-penis , or whatever it is , a kind of androgynous thing . There are the layers , you can kind of see it .


Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide with a human stuck inside .

This one has two heads , and it &apos;s communicating between the two heads . That &apos;s his head ; there &apos;s the chest , you can kind of see the beginning . There are the layers , you can kind of see it .

There are the layers , you can kind of see it . I &apos;m going to go down the body for you : There &apos;s a waterfall coming out of his chest , covering his penis -- or not-penis , or whatever it is , a kind of androgynous thing . Can you see that ?
Anyway , this talk &apos;s all about these boxes , like the boxes we &apos;re in . It &apos;s a brick box . It &apos;s called Pioneer Works . Can you see that ?
You can see the pills coming out , going into one head from this weird statue . It &apos;s a brick box . It &apos;s called Pioneer Works . There &apos;s a little forest scene inside the chest cavity .
You can see the pills coming out , going into one head from this weird statue .
Inside of this box is a physicist , a neuroscientist , a painter , a musician , a writer , a radio station , a museum , a school , a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world ; a garden . And I think that &apos;s the way you change the world .



This box we &apos;re in , the solar system is a box .
And you come together to realize that we &apos;re all in this together , that this delusion of difference -- this idea of countries , of borders , of religion -- doesn &apos;t work . You redefine your insides and the box that you &apos;re living in . Thank you very much .


Thank you very much . You redefine your insides and the box that you &apos;re living in . And you come together to realize that we &apos;re all in this together , that this delusion of difference -- this idea of countries , of borders , of religion -- doesn &apos;t work .
We &apos;re all really made up of the same stuff , in the same box . We shake this box up , and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles .



These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes , the nervous system , as well as the lungs -- where the virus is sleeping , and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy . When they take their anti-HIV drugs , these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood , and increasing the CD4 cell counts . But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects , but mostly bad , because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood , and worse , by the time they get to the sites where it matters most : within the HIV viral reservoirs .
These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes , the nervous system , as well as the lungs -- where the virus is sleeping , and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy . But for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestines and various other organs first . However , upon discontinuation of therapy , the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood .

Now , all this is a big problem in treating HIV with the current drug treatment , which is a life-long treatment that must be swallowed by patients . When they take their anti-HIV drugs , these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood , and increasing the CD4 cell counts . But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects , but mostly bad , because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood , and worse , by the time they get to the sites where it matters most : within the HIV viral reservoirs .
One day , I sat and thought , &quot; Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? &quot; The downside , though , is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution . And this is a big problem , particularly in HIV patients .
However , upon discontinuation of therapy , the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood . One day , I sat and thought , &quot; Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites , without the risk of drug dilution ? &quot;
As a matter of fact , we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes , which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells , in order to deliver drugs within them . These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes , the nervous system , as well as the lungs -- where the virus is sleeping , and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy .



Well , we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug .


As a matter of fact , we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes , which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells , in order to deliver drugs within them . The laser pierces the cell , while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds . Before you even know it , the induced hole becomes immediately repaired .

As a matter of fact , we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes , which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells , in order to deliver drugs within them . Finally , using a third head , which is a drug-spreading sprinkler , we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection , while the laser is again used to poke those cells open . If they can be used for dentistry , for diabetic wound-healing and surgery , they can be used for anything imaginable , including transporting drugs into cells .


Finally , using a third head , which is a drug-spreading sprinkler , we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection , while the laser is again used to poke those cells open . Using the first head , which is our laser , we will make an incision in the site of infection . Using the second head , which is a camera , we meander to the site of infection . Well , we shine a very powerful but super-tiny laser beam onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells while these cells are immersed in liquid containing the drug .

Using the first head , which is our laser , we will make an incision in the site of infection . Using the second head , which is a camera , we meander to the site of infection . Well , the answer is : through a three-headed device .
