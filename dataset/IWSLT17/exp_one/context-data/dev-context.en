Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent . The permanent ice is marked in red . As you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .

Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent . The arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .

The so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here . As you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
It expands in winter and contracts in summer . The so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here . But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
The permanent ice is marked in red . As you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .



Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .

But the volumes are much larger than ever .
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter . And one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north . But the volumes are much larger than ever .




40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow . That &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland . But the volumes are much larger than ever .
In the Andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city . 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow . This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
At the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
In the Himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .


But when they go away , so does much of the drinking water . And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting . This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .


In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack . This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires . The flows have increased .

And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate . This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires . In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
In the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans . This is a completely unsustainable pattern . And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .



Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific , from the Americas , extending westward , and on either side of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans .



And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants . And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron . The biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .








This , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America . One of the coal industry &apos;s ads around Christmas was this one . Video : ♪ ♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .

He &apos;s abundant here in America , and he helps our economy grow . Video : ♪ ♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul . One of the coal industry &apos;s ads around Christmas was this one .

Al Gore : So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns . Al Gore : This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia . That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .





We think it &apos;s clean -- smells good , too . Video : Actor : Clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
Video : Actor : Clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . The fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty .


So let &apos;s take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility . But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything . Take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology . But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .





Take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology . But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .


Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
A plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .




Al Gore : This is the last one . Al Gore : There is an old African proverb that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone .
Man : Future &apos;s over here . Wind , sun , a new energy grid . One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .

If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We need to go far , quickly . Al Gore : There is an old African proverb that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone . Narrator : Repower America . It &apos;s time to get real .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot; Al Gore : There is an old African proverb that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone . Man # 2 : New investments to create high-paying jobs .


It &apos;s nothing if not ambitious . This is the machine below Geneva . We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors .

So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference . This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale . So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference . Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .










So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current . They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire . It &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .

About a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires . They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire . Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current . So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire . So we damaged about 50 of the magnets . So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .



They &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect . So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance . We had to take them out , which we did .

So we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
Now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to refute . Now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot . We will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
We reconditioned them all , fixed them . They &apos;re all on their way back underground now . I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets . By the end of March the LHC will be intact again . We reconditioned them all , fixed them .

Now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to refute .


And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles . One day , Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music . I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the pun -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .




He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .


And we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .

But as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony . It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst . And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .



So , I just started playing . And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto . It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
And as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes . And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto . So , I just started playing .

And as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes . It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst . And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
And in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius . And through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , Juilliard-trained musician . And Nathaniel &apos;s manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
And as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst . And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level . And Nathaniel &apos;s manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .






And I understood that this was the very essence of art .







And I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician . The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
Robert Gupta : I &apos;m going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists . And I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician . Bruno Giussani : Thank you . Thanks .

Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .

I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .

Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games . Now , I have a plan for this , and it entails convincing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games . Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : If we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade . In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically . No . I &apos;m serious . I am .

Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems . I &apos;ve calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week . Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : If we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .

In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically . This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . Truly .

He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming , so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing . No . I &apos;m serious . I am . Now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .


If you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming , so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing . This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . Truly . Here &apos;s why .





That &apos;s an epic win . And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds , is on the verge of an epic win . This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
Now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems . An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win . An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it . This is a gamer who &apos;s on the verge of something called an &quot; epic win . &quot;

This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win . An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it . That &apos;s an epic win .



This is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . Good . And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds , is on the verge of an epic win . Now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .


But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters -- inspired to collaborate and to cooperate . I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it . This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters -- inspired to collaborate and to cooperate . We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games . This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
And in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way . And when we &apos;re in game worlds , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again . I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .


And in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way . What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
And in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
And in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way . But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?

The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away . We feel overcome , we feel overwhelmed , we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away . So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment . What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds . How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ? But it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to try hard .

There are also tons of collaborators . So I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment .


But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away .

And there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing , and we get all this positive feedback .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft ; no sitting around , wringing your hands -- there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done . But it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to try hard .
Everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission . Now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 speaking , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea . But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft ; no sitting around , wringing your hands -- there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done . Now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators . There are also tons of collaborators . Everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .



Now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds . Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .

When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 speaking , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea . But to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up . Now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .

That was the first upright primate .
But to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .

We &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species . So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing . But to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .


It &apos;s based on this great cognitive-science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it . So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing . But it &apos;s also apt , because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
So , consider this really interesting statistic ; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .

And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers . First of all , for children in the United States , 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school , from fifth grade to high school graduation , if you have perfect attendance .

Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell &apos;s new book &quot; Outliers , &quot; so you would have heard of his theory of success , the &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory of success . And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers . So , we have an entire parallel track of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .

This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .

These are our virtuoso gamers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something . We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world . This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .

And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is . Because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
These are our virtuoso gamers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something . Because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers . And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is . The game industry is developing consoles that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet , so that gamers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .

And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is . It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .

And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is . It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers . They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success . OK , think of this as extreme self-motivation . The game industry is developing consoles that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet , so that gamers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .




And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result . And so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation . There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly .


Gamers don &apos;t sit around . Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
We trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over . There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly . You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a half-time job .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly . It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happier working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out . And so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .

And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result . We trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over . And gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .

It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happier working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out . And gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work . You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a half-time job .

Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories . Second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft wiki .
So , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective : So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world . Five million people use it every month . Second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft wiki .

So , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective : So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .


They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft . They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world . Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories .
They are building an epic story . Okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing : Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals . Second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft wiki .
These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world . And the only problem is , they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world . Okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing : Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals . And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;


And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exuberant . And he &apos;s an economist , so he &apos;s rational . There &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova .
But he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life . And he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot; They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exuberant . There &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova . But he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .

He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .

But he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world . But it is not , by any means , an optimal situation . And he &apos;s an economist , so he &apos;s rational .
Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now . So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .

I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .


And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings , and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why . So , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games , and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games . Before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
So , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games , and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games . It was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution . And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games , because games are so engaging , and immerse us in such satisfying , blissful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .



Herodotus says that games , particularly dice games , were invented in the kingdom of Lydia , during a time of famine . So , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games , and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games . And then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .


We &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering -- we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games . So , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games , and they set up a kingdom-wide policy : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games . According to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .


We &apos;re using games to escape real-world suffering -- we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games . They played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure . Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today .




So this crazy story might be true . And so , recently , scientists have suggested that Herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true . They might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
They might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
So this crazy story might be true . But recently , DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans , who then led to the Roman Empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians . Okay , we can do that .

And so , recently , scientists have suggested that Herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true . Now , this sounds crazy , right ? But recently , DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans , who then led to the Roman Empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians .






They played dice games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years . We &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 . Now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from .
That was 16 years ago .



I &apos;m just going to very briefly show you three games that I &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures . We do not want to try to predict the future . Let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real-world problems .


We want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win . We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality . We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .

The oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . So when you come to the game , you sign up , tell us where you live , and then we give you real-time news videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected ,
how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there &apos;s rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . And then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos . This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage .

Challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game . So for the next world-saving game , we decided to aim higher -- bigger problem than just peak oil . This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .


But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil . This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course . This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
We asked people to come online -- almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie . And the premise was , a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet . You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astronaut , the scientist , the ex-convict , and they all have something to do to save the world .

So for the next world-saving game , we decided to aim higher -- bigger problem than just peak oil .
But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot; They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online , Google &quot; Superstruct , &quot; and see . So , finally , the last game , we &apos;re launching it March 3rd . This is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online , Google &quot; Superstruct , &quot; and see . Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .


Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills . I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .

If you complete the game , you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator , class of 2010 . I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .

I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century . I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world . When I look forward to the next decade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want , so I say : Let the world-changing games begin .

Something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .

For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot; And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s . And then I &apos;ll explain why I explained it .

And then I &apos;ll explain why I explained it . In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick . In other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .

This is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s . I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .





And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I &apos;m just going to squeeze my wrist right here . In fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off . I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .





Nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . And you can examine everything .
So , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick methodologically .







I say I &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie . In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this . And then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .













It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s like aspirin shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect . A colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule . Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they &apos;re sugar pills .

If you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than tablets in any form . It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s like aspirin shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect . But if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective .
A colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule . ... these dosages have something to do with it .






And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
And if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle . It &apos;s a really , this graph , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle . And the form has something to do with it .
And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real . I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white pill .
And if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle . The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle . Right ? A syringe with some inert -- a couple CCs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ...



I &apos;m going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
That &apos;s my skin right there . This is not a Hollywood special effect . This is a seven-inch hatpin . It &apos;s very , very sharp , and I &apos;m going to just sterilize it a tiny bit . I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
This is a seven-inch hatpin . It &apos;s very , very sharp , and I &apos;m going to just sterilize it a tiny bit . I &apos;m going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .


You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to . So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce . OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
So , I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it . OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this . That &apos;s my skin right there . This is not a Hollywood special effect .
I &apos;m going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side . Now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .

So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce .
So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce . So , I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .


Now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick . I know what people think when they see this . So , let me give you a little peek .


Yeah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; How &apos;s that look out there ? Pretty good . People in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .

People in the satellite room are starting to move in now .

Well let me work up some blood for you .
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
Yeah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; That really is my skin . That is not a Hollywood special effect . How &apos;s that look out there ? Pretty good .




I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re getting queasy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing . I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much . But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
Well let me work up some blood for you . I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re getting queasy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing . Normally now , I would take the needle out .



I &apos;ve loved only two .
So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life . Even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability . That first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
I &apos;ve loved only two . I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months . So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .


It was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu . Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : How do we keep fish on our menus ? &quot; Absolutely , &quot; I said .



One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability . Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : How do we keep fish on our menus ? So you could feel good about selling it .

One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability . I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .


Ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &apos;ve collapsed . It &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction . For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .




A lot of arguments against it : Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . Take tuna , a major drawback . It &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one . So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
A lot of arguments against it : Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . Take tuna , a major drawback . That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna . It &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot; &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot; A lot of arguments against it : Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . Take tuna , a major drawback .
The day before the event , I called the head of P.R. for the company . So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right . Not very sustainable .
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot; &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot; That feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .

So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right . &quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot; And then he added , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot;

2.5 to one , great . Let &apos;s call him Don . &quot; Great , &quot; I said . Got off the phone .
That feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said . So the next day , just before the event , I called Don . &quot; Great , &quot; I said . Got off the phone .
&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot; And that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : What the hell is a sustainable protein ?

That feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said . 2.5 to one , great .
&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;

&quot; Sustainable proteins , &quot; he said . &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot; And that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : What the hell is a sustainable protein ?


So the next day , just before the event , I called Don . &quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot; I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot; Well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets . He said , &quot; Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . &quot;






I said , &quot; What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot; I said , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot; There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;




I actually am . This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
She kind of set us up . It came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color . It &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story . No , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
No , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken . This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .




Who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ? Amazingly , it was still delicious . And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
Who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ? And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it . The chef had overcooked it .


He &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .





And ecologically , it was a disaster . They built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river . Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
They built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river . They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands . It killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
Until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
And ecologically , it was a disaster . They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands . And so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .

They did it by draining the land . They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands . And ecologically , it was a disaster .

They flooded the canals . Instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in . They literally flipped the switch .

They reversed the flow of water . The farm &apos;s incredible . I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
They reversed the flow of water .
What did they do ? They reversed the flow of water . Instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .

I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this . He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee . I was there not long ago with Miguel .

Okay ? There we are slogging through the wetlands , and I &apos;m panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology lecture . They created a 27,000-acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
Now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton . Here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite . And here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
The farm &apos;s incredible . They created a 27,000-acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .

Now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton . It turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa . I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
Here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite .
Here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite .





And then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants . I asked him how he became such an expert on fish . It turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing . I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot; &quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing .

And then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants . I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot; And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .


The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish . Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild . There is no feed .

&quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing . The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish . He pointed at the algae .
There is no feed . Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild . Later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot; &quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing .


The system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-renewing .
Feasting ? I was totally confused . And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see . The plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .


And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .

I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot; At that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change . They &apos;re feasting . &quot;





&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds . I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot; He said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively .

Okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators . Well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species . This is an ecological network .
A fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary . The shrimp eat the phytoplankton . I said , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;


He said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively . This is an ecological network . They brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .



So the pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot; Okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators . The shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
And every evening , they fly 150 miles back . I said , &quot; Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ? They brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ? Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm . Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .








I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it seared , I don &apos;t like it crispy . It &apos;s that acrid , tar-like flavor . Yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .


It tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .

Yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin . It &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff . And then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , &quot; he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators . It &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff . And when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .





So , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well . OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators . It &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
And when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;

What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .


You might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bass or beef cattle . What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good . We &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; No , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world . One billion people will go hungry today .
We love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic . We &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers . And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years . And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot; Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot; Can I be honest ? And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;


I don &apos;t love that question . One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage . Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
Our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources .

That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture . Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years . Not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .

Not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea . That &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture . Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture . Feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot; We should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ? Or better : How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ? It &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
Want to feed the world ? Or better : How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ? It &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ? Want to feed the world ? It &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .



To do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future . Or better : How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ? Farms that aren &apos;t worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .

To do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future . Instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .







I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction . In high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day . And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .

And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope . And I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
And I was an artist . I could draw . I could paint . You know , I was a real science geek .
And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope . And I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had . So , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope . And I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans . And you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope . And so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .




I could draw . I could paint . I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook . And I was an artist .

And so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff . You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads . And I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .

You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads . But I didn &apos;t let that daunt me . I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely . And an interesting thing happened : The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .

I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely .


So , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 . I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live . I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .

I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives . But when I chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California . And I &apos;ve learned that that deep-ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination . And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .

And I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on . So , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
So , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense . And with &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking . And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images .

Something interesting came out of &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG . And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot; So , you know , merging the two passions .

And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images . So , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense . Something interesting came out of &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .



Something interesting came out of &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG . They were seeing something magical . And so that got me very excited .


And it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one . And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- barely broke even , I should say -- I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic . You know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .

So , with &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much farther . And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- barely broke even , I should say -- I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic . Working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude in that film . The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .

And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production . So , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists . And it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .





And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .

So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG , and the main characters would all be in CG , and the world would be in CG . And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production . But we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .


But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . We &apos;re going to film it for real . So , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .

But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . We &apos;re going to film it for real . And I talked them into funding an expedition . And the envelope pushed back , and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
Secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of &quot; Titanic . &quot; Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port . You know , I went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Juliet &apos; on a ship : &quot; It &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
It will be really important . It will be a great marketing hook . &quot;


But , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission . Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port . Now , that blew my mind .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things . But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . We &apos;re going to film it for real . You know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .



And so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration . You get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
But , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission . And I thought like , &quot; Wow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie . And so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .

Because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window . And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things . And so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration .




And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me . After the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I &apos;m going to go be a full-time explorer for a while . &quot;

And so , we started planning these expeditions .
We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic . So , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more . As we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .

And so , we started planning these expeditions .

Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it . And I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship . And so , we started planning these expeditions .
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .

Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic . And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
And I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship . And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence . We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .

So , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .

And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .

And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence . So , it was this absolutely remarkable experience . And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .



So , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically aliens right here on Earth . And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .




And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to water plumes . And taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on . And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
And you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot . And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to water plumes .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid . But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep . And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .

I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions . And taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
So , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science . But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep . And I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .



And you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .


People sort of think I went away between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
We don &apos;t make money at these damn shows . I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions . Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else . Made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience . No fame , no glory , no money . What are you doing ?

People sort of think I went away between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach . You &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team . When you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human-performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .

Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And it really changed the dynamic . So , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; Avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before . And in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .

And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period . And in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else . So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .

So , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; Avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before . And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period . So , people have commented on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
So , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; Avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before . So , what can we synthesize out of all this ? And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period .

To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .

And it completely changed how I do movies .

And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world . And we became a family , over a four-and-half year period . To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .

Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality . So , what can we synthesize out of all this ?


It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own . And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .









It &apos;s called Pivot , and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , accidents .
If we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about . We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
This is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age . We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .

And if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men . It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web . You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .

So you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic . And if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ? With Pivot , you can drill into a decade .
You can drill into a particular year .
With Pivot , you can drill into a decade . You can jump right into a specific issue . And if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?

It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web . I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan , so I &apos;ll go ahead and I &apos;ll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which Lance Armstrong &apos;s been a part of . Now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out -- you &apos;re not searching , you &apos;re not browsing .

So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy . You can jump right into a specific issue .


What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .


But even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
Right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia . So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .


Looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them . It &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them . Now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .

Right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia . Looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .

So looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my boss -- and one has come from music . So we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners . Looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
So you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
Now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .

So I can step back , pop right back into a specific section . So you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction . So Pivot , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .


So Pivot , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this . And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise . So you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
So you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction . Now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way . And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
So I can drill into what I &apos;ve done over specific time frames . And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , I was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for Bing , over here for Live Labs Pivot .

We talk about the curse of information overload . If we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information . So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .

And , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
If we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .




But in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness . There is a lot of happiness coaching . Everybody talks about happiness these days .


And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
But in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness . This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is . I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is .




It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things . And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness . This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .

The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life . I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life . And the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance . It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .

He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience . Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound . They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .

And then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience . They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep . He had had 20 minutes of glorious music .

It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot; Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness . There is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .

And then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot; Now , the remembering self is a storyteller .

Those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. or &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; or something like that . It &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .


I won &apos;t go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s . And let me begin with one example . Here are two patients , those are their recordings .
I won &apos;t go into detail . It &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s . They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds . And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot;


Clearly , Patient B suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more . And here is a surprise . They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .

They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds . And here is a surprise .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot; The stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . And it &apos;s a very easy question .
And here is a surprise .



And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story . And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory . Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;




And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience . From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time . And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience . Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .


Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self . Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously . From the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .




Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self . And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience . It has moments of experience , one after the other .
Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously . What defines a story ? I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .

I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace . Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self . It has moments of experience , one after the other . And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us . So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct . Now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ? It has moments of experience , one after the other . I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self . And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us . I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added . Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self . That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation . For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added . Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .

So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct . For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added . And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
Now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories . For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added . And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us . Now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories . That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story . We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences . It is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
The experiencing self has no voice in this choice . We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences . From the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .

That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self . And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .

And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need . And in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story . For the remembering self , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added .
And this is a bit hard to justify I think . And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need . I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .

And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences . I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self . And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .

That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self . And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need . The experiencing self has no voice in this choice .

And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years . And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need . I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .

And basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need . I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?

I mean , how much do we consume our memories ? Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ? Now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .

Now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .


Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer . Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves . Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ? So I want you to think about a thought experiment . Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .

And they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process . Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness . Now , would you choose the same vacation ? And if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .

Imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .

And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ? And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time . If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ? And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time . Now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .

It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life . If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing . And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ? So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ? If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately . And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time . So you can ask : How happy is the experiencing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?

And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time . So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing . And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different . It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life . The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately . If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines . You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .

You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa . And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately . So in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves . Well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .

Well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty . You have that much uncertainty . You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .



You have that much uncertainty .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important . So the correlation is low .

We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
So the correlation is low . We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self . So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
It is a completely different notion . Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live . When you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .

We know that money is very important , goals are very important .

Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are . And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier . When you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier . Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live . The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
But now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier . But now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California . Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier . So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer . Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .

Well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .





Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey . I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find . It is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .

Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find . Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey . When we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .



And it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ... The more money you earn , the more satisfied you are . We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat . Clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly . 60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
Above that , we get an absolutely flat line .


DK : You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy . That does not hold for emotions .
In terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story . DK : You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy . Clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .


If people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .


DK : You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy . This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come . This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
In the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population . How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .

DK : You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon . This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics . Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
In the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .






Now , the price of energy has come down over time . So , the climate changes will be terrible for them . Also , the price of energy is very important to them .

But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet . And that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest . Also , the price of energy is very important to them .
The climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won &apos;t grow : There will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t support .
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
And that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest . The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses . So , the climate changes will be terrible for them . And that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest .

The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things . In fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
And so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world . The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things . Now , the price of energy has come down over time .





And the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise . I asked the top scientists on this several times : Do we really have to get down to near zero ? Now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .







It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet . For each American , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton . Now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
It &apos;s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero . This equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication : So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy . And , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .

And , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .

So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero . Now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .
The world today has 6.8 billion people .
The second factor is the services we use . Now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look . So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .

The world today has 6.8 billion people . First , we &apos;ve got population . Now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .

In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .

And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up . Here we have a very basic service : Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?

These are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet . Now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .
The second factor is the services we use . Now , efficiency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news . Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially .
Here we have a very basic service : Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
Here we have a very basic service : Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ? In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .


Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially . And so the question is : Can you actually get that to zero ? So let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .


And so , overall here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six . Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially . We have something that &apos;s not going up .
But for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it . Almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .


If you burn coal , no . Almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 . The microprocessor is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
So let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
Almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 . And so , we need energy miracles . The Internet and its services are a miracle .





This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline . So , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles . Now , when I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date . Is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot; This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline .

Is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot; I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year . So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
So here we have some natural fireflies . I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year . So , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos . Is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot; Usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .

So here we have some natural fireflies . I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year . It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .

Those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue . Who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
This is a lot of volume . We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers . What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
Let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .

It also has three big problems : Cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons . Who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ? What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
Who &apos;s going to be sure ? Next would be nuclear . Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long-term issue .


And , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that . It also has three big problems : Cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons . Who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
People need to feel good about it .

This is a lot of volume . And then what do you do with the waste ?


One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant . This is energy farming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant . These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant . And they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disadvantages . This is energy farming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .



And so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it &apos;s not available . One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant . So , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .

And , finally , this storage problem . And so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it &apos;s not available .

Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?





Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds . Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ? Is it a Manhattan Project ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach . In each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people . And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
In each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people . Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
Vinod Khosla &apos;s investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that . And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising . And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .

There are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid . The idea of TerraPower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent , which is the U235 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the U238 . &quot; Vinod Khosla &apos;s investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .

There are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
And , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .


The idea of TerraPower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent , which is the U235 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the U238 . &quot; You actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today &apos;s reactors . It breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
And , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .


It breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle . And , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet . I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
And , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet . So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
This is the leftover , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called depleted uranium . So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward . That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .

You can see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor . It breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle . And , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .

And , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .




So , the other grade is : Are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?

So , the other grade is : Are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether . And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
That &apos;s a key element of making that report card . But in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs . That really is very important , that we get there .

So , the other grade is : Are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ? That &apos;s super important . That &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
These breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed . We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions : The less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .

We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions : The less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
So , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?


These breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed . But in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs . The Al Gore book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;

It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
So this is a wish .
This is the one with the greatest impact .

If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who &apos;s president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick . There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .

This is the one with the greatest impact . They should discuss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches . If we don &apos;t get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .


When countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss the CO2 .
We need to go for more research funding . When countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss the CO2 . We need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .






CA : And so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?


The tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these . CA : It &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution . CA : And so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?

So , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities . Once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .

So , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities . And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with . BG : Yeah . Well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .

And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
BG : Yeah . Well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .


BG : Well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China -- I &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda . CA : So , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ? So I &apos;m optimistic . You know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
It &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built . CA : So , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ? BG : Well , we need -- for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
It &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .

And , you know , TerraPower , if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
That &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet . BG : Well , we need -- for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
And , you know , TerraPower , if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
We certainly need one to succeed . And there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this . BG : An energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
BG : Well , we need -- for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy . It would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater . You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .


There &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us . And so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own . Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
In the nuclear space , there are other innovators . There &apos;s a liquid-type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us . CA : In terms of big-scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .


Some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .



BG : If you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over-eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : Then where do you go ? You may need heart surgery or something .


The main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
CA : Climate skeptics : If you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
Are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?


The fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this . CA : And so , that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
And so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact , the IPCC report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot; The thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste . Are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste . There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things . The fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
You make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later . The fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .


But my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;

I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
And even Lomborg has changed .


The disaster is for that two billion . CA : Well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much . Unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
And even Lomborg has changed .
The R &amp; amp ; D piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
The disaster is for that two billion . CA : Well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much . His shtick now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &amp; amp ; D getting more discussed ? &quot;

Antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot; I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .

I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already finished editing the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what I &apos;d find . Antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;

So , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting . But , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me . I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
So , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting . Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .

So , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s empowered ? It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words . It &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .

Here &apos;s the updated version of this entry . So , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s empowered ?

It &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values . Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people . By casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power .
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
Wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ? I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .


And , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course . I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them , had names for them . I hated them . And , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
And , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course . His name was Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce , so he went by Dr. P.
And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children . Now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .

And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .

Certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , And , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow .

The human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I &apos;m going to make an admission : This phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .



Certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves ,


Implicit in this phrase of &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .



And , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .



There is adversity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet adversity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .



Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .

Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
By not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have . So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it . And , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character . By not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have . So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
To paraphrase : It &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change . We are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community . This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character .

So it &apos;s not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity . And , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .


This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character . From Darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .


We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times . And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of . And , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .
Maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power . From Darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation . We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .

I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy . So , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill . Maybe we can see it as change .

Maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power . And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of . I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy . There &apos;s no normal . Maybe we can see it as change .

There &apos;s no normal . I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy . There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ? Now , who &apos;s normal ? I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
There &apos;s no normal . Now , who &apos;s normal ? I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .




If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community . There &apos;s evidence that Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community . There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?





And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot; And so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents . And I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is .


And I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is . Oh , that guy . And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;

I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother &apos;s womb . &quot; And , because I was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .

And so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .


And he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will . He said to me , &quot; I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot; I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
And he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will . The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then . And there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second . He said to me , &quot; I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
See , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking . The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .

In fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot; You &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense . In fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot;

See , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re off . You &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
There was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .

There was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools . Well , they took , over a three-month period , D-level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at A-level . It &apos;s separating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
It &apos;s called the streaming trials . We call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the States . And the &quot; A students &quot; get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc . In fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot;

A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too . There was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .


So , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine . If instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well . Well , they took , over a three-month period , D-level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-month period , they were performing at A-level .
The teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made . When a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being . They were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A-students , &apos; these are the &apos; D-students . &apos; &quot; And that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .

So , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .

How would you like to be better than you are ? Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ? How about living longer with good health ?
How about living longer with good health ?



Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident ? Which one would you like the most ? Or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina .

How many would opt for memory ? Creativity .

How many people would choose creativity ? Creativity .

How many people would choose creativity ? Ah , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor . Creativity .
A few less .

A few . Probably about as many as there are creative people here . How many would opt for memory ? Ah , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor .



Or , is it , perhaps , possible ? If you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world . But if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
If you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- I give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .

We have been here for about 130,000 years .

We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
The human part of this branch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in . It may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same . In this picture , I &apos;ve put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .


Some have come and gone .

And speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ? This is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas . I mean think of it , when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ?

Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics ? I mean think of it , when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image , do you think about the bacteria ? And you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .

It &apos;s really like an Easy Street for bacteria , with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit .
But otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria . But otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life . And you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .

They help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases . Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ? Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago -- the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of proto-life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-celled organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 130,000 years .












And very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expendable . In fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction . But at the time multi-celled organisms come online , things start to change .
In fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
Sexual reproduction enters the picture . And very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome , the rest of the body becomes expendable .



And one night , there &apos;s a knock at his hotel room door . She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s fine , &quot; says George , &quot; I &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;




Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .
I wanted to restore health from disease . I wanted us to live long and healthy lives . I came to realize , as a physician , that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
I was trying to preserve the body . She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot; Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .

Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived . It doesn &apos;t necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest . I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .

I wanted to restore health from disease . Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived . I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .

Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived . Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment . At the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous-vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them .




And secondly , we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it . A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature . So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , I would say that there are a number of possibilities .

And the reasoning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population . The first is that we will not evolve . At the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sous-vide cooked fish , nevertheless , have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them .
We have reached a kind of equipoise .
I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .

A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature .
Consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring . They &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females . And by the way , we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature .


Now how could this come about ? How could it be possible that we would do this ? I call it neo-evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .

What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ? Wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ? Consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring .
Think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases . Wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ? The Human Genome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .

The Human Genome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .

Today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in the space of about a week . If we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible . The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .


It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,000-dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone . The year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months . Just a week ago , the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer , two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way -- what Frances Arnold calls &quot; directed evolution . &quot;


What if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ?
A couple of years ago , the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fibroblast , and by manipulating just four genes , he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell -- a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body . Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ? The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .

What if you could change the sperm and the ova , or change the newly fertilized egg , and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life -- eliminate the diabetes , eliminate the hemophilia , reduce the risk of cancer ? And then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super-attributes , hyper-capacities -- that better memory .

We &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .

Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ? We &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years . Will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine ? And then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super-attributes , hyper-capacities -- that better memory . Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?


And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old-style evolution into neo-evolution . These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face . Will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?



And most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inherit the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wisely ? For better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us . Or , will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?




Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us . So , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically ,
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships .

In a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie . They &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .

In a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
In a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
Most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping . If they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .


And as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles . And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information . One of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
If they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered . And they can also sense their motion and tilt . And these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested . If we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .

Then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary . So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I &apos;m making with a simple equation program . Basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary . There are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle .
Basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .


And , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions . That &apos;s our youngest beta tester , down there on the right . So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .

Then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try . Now , this is an interactive cartoon application . So to him , they were just blocks .

So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video . They really loved it . All you have to say is , &quot; Make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
And he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them . Now , this is an interactive cartoon application . And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .

Now , this is an interactive cartoon application .






And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable . DM : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which Siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want . DM : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which Siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums . Video : DM : We &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .

Video : DM : Now I &apos;ll put some percussion in . Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression . Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the drums , so I can control the effect live .
Now I put a bass line in . Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression . Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the drums , so I can control the effect live .
Video : DM : And now I &apos;ll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression . So I don &apos;t have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go . Video : DM : I can rearrange the sequence while it plays .

And now , finally , I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable , tilted to the left .





This is just not some blue sky thinking . But not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier .

It is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .





So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier . Its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high-agility movements . We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .

And that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate . We are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life -- 20s , 30s , 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option . It senses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .



And that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , I must say .



Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set . It has sensors . It &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set . There are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips , as well as her knee joints , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait . It &apos;s completely non-invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .

Not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;




I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me . In a split second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis . Not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
Not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot; In a split second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis . Adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again , to rock climb and even handcycle .


As you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .



But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be . I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
Now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
When I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life . Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames . The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .


But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be . Here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .

The dog ! I was stunned with jealousy . When I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life . He said , &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .


So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes . I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door . He said , &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero .

So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
I need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door . In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis . Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero .
So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .


In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis . Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life . Be a mentor .
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life . If you have something to give , give it now . Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .

So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait . Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .



Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .

Be a mentor .

It &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business . Ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .





Now , chimpanzees are well-known for their aggression . But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution . While chimpanzees are dominated by big , scary guys , bonobo society is run by empowered females .

Bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .


That means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
Not surprisingly , this destruction also endangers bonobo survival . They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle , and it has been very difficult to study them . The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War .
But unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes . But unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution . While chimpanzees are dominated by big , scary guys , bonobo society is run by empowered females .



Bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives . Not surprisingly , this destruction also endangers bonobo survival . Play is not just child &apos;s games .




It &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game . Play is the glue that binds us together . Who are these cousins ?
It &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game . Play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections . And when you watch bonobo play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter , dance and ritual .

For us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance . Play is not just child &apos;s games . Bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .

First , it &apos;s a ball game bonobo-style -- and I do not mean football .
It &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game . Now , I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild . And when you watch bonobo play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter , dance and ritual .
Only I think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?

So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans .
So here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .

Yeah . Play &apos;s a shapeshifter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew . But play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
But play &apos;s a shapeshifter . I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
But play &apos;s a shapeshifter .

Play &apos;s a shapeshifter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew . And I want you to see , this is Fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun . And I want you to see , this is Fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water . In other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .



In order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play . But will we make the most of our playfulness ? For bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
In other words , play is our adaptive wildcard . The secret is that play is the key to these capacities . But will we make the most of our playfulness ?

In times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent . Play &apos;s essential . For bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
Play is not frivolous . In times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent . In other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .

In order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play . Play &apos;s essential . Play is not frivolous .



So just imagine that for a moment . Now I don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you spend all that time imagining that conception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me . And in this scenario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome , meeting that X chromosome of the egg .


And in the other case , the sperm is carrying an X chromosome , meeting the X chromosome of the egg .
And in this scenario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome , meeting that X chromosome of the egg . As the one hat , I do history of anatomy . Both are viable ; both take off .
And in this scenario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome , meeting that X chromosome of the egg . And in the other case , the sperm is carrying an X chromosome , meeting the X chromosome of the egg . I &apos;m a historian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .

The other hat that I &apos;ve worn in my work is as an activist , as a patient advocate -- or , as I sometimes say , as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
So I wear two hats in most of what I do . So some of what I &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body . Some of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .
And a lot of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types . Some of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .

So in one instance , you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis , and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads , which we all have in the fetal life , to become testes .
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone .
So in one instance , you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis , and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads , which we all have in the fetal life , to become testes . When the child is born , she looks like a girl .



She is a girl . She is raised as a girl . And it &apos;s often not until she hits puberty and she &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here . When the child is born , she looks like a girl .
And they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus , she actually has testes inside , and she has a Y chromosome . As a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path . Females , like males , have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands .
And it &apos;s often not until she hits puberty and she &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here . Now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not . They &apos;re in the back of our body .






The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome .
And the adrenal glands make androgens , which are a masculinizing hormone . Females , like males , have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands . What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia .
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don &apos;t actually know my chromosomal make-up but I think I &apos;m probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive . And as a consequence , his genitals were masculinzed , his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones .
And the adrenal glands make androgens , which are a masculinizing hormone . They &apos;re in the back of our body . The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome .
And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internally .

And as a consequence , his genitals were masculinzed , his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones . And it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internally .

He had XX chromosomes , and in the womb , his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created , essentially , a masculine hormonal environment . What he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia . Another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
Another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside . Okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex .
So sex can come in lots of different varieties .

Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis , which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it .
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , allegedly , is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history .

Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis , which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it . The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s dwarfism , or it &apos;s conjoined twinning , or it &apos;s an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health . The reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s dwarfism , or it &apos;s conjoined twinning , or it &apos;s an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health . In many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy . Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis , which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it .
And when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it startles us in terms of those categorizations .

And when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it startles us in terms of those categorizations .

So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , allegedly , is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history .

And our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism .
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism . So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , allegedly , is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history . And so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
And when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it startles us in terms of those categorizations . And I had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
And our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism . So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism . And so we have this terribly simplistic idea .


So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
In fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and intersex and female and intersex ; we actually draw that line on nature . I had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; Which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female ? &quot; Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner , Caster Semenya , had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin .

And it &apos;s not just in terms of sex . In fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and intersex and female and intersex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
And as we get farther and farther with our science , we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had are probably overly simplistic . So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought . And I had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
As we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas . So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .

One of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the United States today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fetal life . We look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees . One of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the United States today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .

We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fetal life . But today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings . And as a consequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .

At most , they &apos;d stick a feather on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twitched , they didn &apos;t bury them yet .
If it stopped twitching , you bury them . In the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead . And as a consequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .

But today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings . Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense . At most , they &apos;d stick a feather on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twitched , they didn &apos;t bury them yet .
And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy . So in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first admit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the Founding Fathers . But today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense . So in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first admit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the Founding Fathers . I &apos;m a political progressive , I defend people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .

So in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first admit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the Founding Fathers . The Founding Fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why . I mean , they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical &quot; 1776 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally forgettable .
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .

The monarchs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of DNA , but they did have a concept of birthright .
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal . So as you all recall , what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy . The monarchs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of DNA , but they did have a concept of birthright .
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years . The Founding Fathers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .



What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years . They leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy , not the difference in anatomy , and that was a really radical thing to do . They were moving away from supernatural explanations , and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power , where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright .

So as you all recall , what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
And that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .





And if you look , for example , in the Declaration of Independence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s God . They &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .

What happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the Founding Fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot; And women successfully argued that . They were moving towards a naturalistic concept .



So as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality . And in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future .
What happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the Founding Fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot; Again , people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy , again , successfully . So what happened years afterward ?


Next came the successful Civil Rights movement , where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about , &quot; Ain &apos;t I a woman ? &quot; So what happened years afterward ? And women successfully argued that .

Now mind you , I want to maintain some divisions , anatomically , in our culture . For example , I don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain . I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy . But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .



I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy . Now mind you , I want to maintain some divisions , anatomically , in our culture . Henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on March 1 , 1980 .
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain . I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy . I don &apos;t want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
We have two beings , both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day . Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink . Henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on March 1 , 1980 .
Let &apos;s imagine one of them , Mary , is born three months prematurely , so she &apos;s born on June 1 , 1980 . Henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on March 1 , 1980 . We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink . I don &apos;t want to say five-year-olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
So there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain .

Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink . So we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable . We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .

Mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry . Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink . Henry can marry in every state a woman , but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman .
And the question to me becomes : What do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ? I don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us . Henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , biologically , except in terms of when he was born .

And the question to me becomes : What do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ? Henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , biologically , except in terms of when he was born . Henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the XY one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted , which Mary does not need to worry about .

And the question to me becomes : What do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ? So for example , Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a Y chromosome , and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome .


So for example , Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a Y chromosome , and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome . But this is also very bizarre , because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome . Now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude : &quot; Well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot; But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .

And I want to say , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;


I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed , intelligent , mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know . I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , I have to admit , that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know .

He says we should judge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond anatomy .

How do you judge people based on the content of character ? So how do we operationalize the question of content of character ? But in practice , how do you do it ?
We &apos;ve done a really good job struggling with democracy , and I think we would do a good job in the future .






My response to him was , &quot; Well , have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery ? &quot;

We &apos;ve done a really good job struggling with democracy , and I think we would do a good job in the future . And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups . And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .

But when I was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .

Well , just to close , I want to suggest to you that I &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers . And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups . And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .


And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .



But the more I thought about his question , the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism . Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender , so there &apos;s nothing feminine about feminism . &quot; So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .

He said , &quot; Tell me what &apos;s feminine about feminism . &quot; But the more I thought about his question , the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism .

That is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable .

I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores . Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet . I &apos;m Jessi , and this is my suitcase .
I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .

I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores .

I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt . Will it be under $ 20 ? Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet .






I brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it . I mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ? I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED .


And I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now . I mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ? Exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase .
I was betting that I &apos;d be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs . Exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase . I brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it .





You can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 . And I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now . This whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week .
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great . This whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week . I call this &quot; Shiny Tiger . &quot;







Sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dress-up , or that I remind them of their seven-year-old . I like to smile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot; If you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .



Sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dress-up , or that I remind them of their seven-year-old . I like to smile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot; Wednesday : Embrace your inner child .






If you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off . Thank you . And I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .



It &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations . I don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look . If you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .

So before I go home to Brooklyn , I &apos;m going to donate everything back . Because the lesson I &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go . Thank you very much .
I don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look . So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .

And if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race . Now some time ago , if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car . Now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian originally , and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades .

This is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system . Now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
If we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal . They &apos;re becoming like computers in open air . Just as an aside , I wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s crust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
And , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated . What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives . Our cities , over the past few years , just have been blanketed with networks , electronics .
They &apos;re becoming like computers in open air . And basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component . Beyond cities , all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects .
So if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .



And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .



In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... Well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us . Beyond cities , all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects .
In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator . That &apos;s from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year , during the summer . In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
Well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us . And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
It &apos;s called &quot; Talk to Me . &quot;

Let &apos;s starting with sensing . In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator . And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .









Now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network . You see the timeline on the top . And anyway , Italy won at the end .



It &apos;s morning , before the match .

Italy wins . Yeah . Second half . End of normal time . It &apos;s morning , before the match .
Early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
Zidane , the headbutt in a moment .


The following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time . Well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center . France scores . Italy scores .
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo , where , since Roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day . The following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time . Italy wins . Yeah .
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo , where , since Roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day . And then everybody moved down .
Well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center . Italy wins . Yeah . First overtime , second .
Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from . This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer , how they came together . Well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
Well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from . Another quick example about sensing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume . You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo , where , since Roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from . So in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system . Well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .

And then everybody moved down . Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from . Then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .

So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway . But we know very little about where things go . Then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .

We can actually do the same thing with much less energy . With this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system . This data was not available before .

My colleague at MIT , Assaf Biderman , he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing , but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actuating our environment . It started with a question by the mayor of the city , who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture . And if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
And the question was : How could technology , new technology , be added to that ? And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was , imagine this pipe , and you &apos;ve got valves , solenoid valves , taps , opening and closing .


If those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text . And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo . Well , we presented this to Mayor Belloch .
It started with a question by the mayor of the city , who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture . And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was , imagine this pipe , and you &apos;ve got valves , solenoid valves , taps , opening and closing . You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water .

The whole building is made of water .




Or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , You know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; They demolished the building . &quot; And if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof . No , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
No , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears . And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
The whole building is made of water . You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .

No , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .

And here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water . And if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof . But actually that night , it was even more fun .
Or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , You know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; They demolished the building . &quot; Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet . The roof also is covered with water .
Here &apos;s the building working .
And here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
And that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people . And that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design . And here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
And here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water . All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building , because the way of engaging with the building became something different .


Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space . And that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design . Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water , and then projections on them .

Here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water , and then projections on them . Or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pixels &apos; position .

That &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying . Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space . Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .

Or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pixels &apos; position .
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions . Imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space . Here is the video .

And imagine each of them then controlled by people . But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .

Or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pixels &apos; position .
You can have each pixel having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so . We &apos;ve been working with Roberto Bolle , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire . And imagine each of them then controlled by people .
Imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution . Here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before . You can play with a different type .




It &apos;s both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture . We &apos;ve been working with Roberto Bolle , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire .

You see on the left the pixels , the different resolutions being captured .


But then , once we have the pixels , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation . So you can reconstruct a whole movement . And the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud .




And the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud . That means something built in a city . Now today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-organizing power of networks , to the physical one .
Now today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-organizing power of networks , to the physical one .
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one . And the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud . So the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .

This can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol . But tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today &apos;s pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .

This has been digitizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet . That means something built in a city . And those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pixels .


You can move inside , have different types of experiences . So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like London &apos;s new mountaintop . You can enter inside it .
You can enter inside it . It &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pixels . You can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .

The cloud is a cloud , again , made of pixels , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles . And those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pixels . You can move inside , have different types of experiences .
Thank you .
So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like London &apos;s new mountaintop . It &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pixels .







Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion . But the reality is far from it . They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .

Each iceberg has its own individual personality .
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake , year after year . As the iceberg melts , it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life .
Each iceberg has its own individual personality . I approach photographing these icebergs as if I &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .

And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .


As the iceberg melts , it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life . As an iceberg melts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere . And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .








It &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .


It &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters . You can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there . This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg .



I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects . TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s . This guy &apos;s name is TEMPT .




He only has use of his eyes . And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony , TEMPT , and his cause . This guy &apos;s name is TEMPT .
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed . This guy &apos;s name is TEMPT . I was exposed to him .
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s . And that was the onset of ALS .








I just want to be able to communicate with him And I said , &quot; Wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking -- don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot; That &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along . These devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;

I just want to be able to communicate with him And I said , &quot; Wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking -- don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot; Because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
That &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along . Because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot; And I said , &quot; Well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;

Because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot; So I showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash .



I met these guys called GRL , Graffiti Research Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space . So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again ? Well that would be awesome . &quot;

One , we battered down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine .

But for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the Venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this . And he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m not worthy . This guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .

The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house . My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house . One , we battered down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine .
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house . We took a PS3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free . My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .
We took a PS3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free . And now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations . My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .


A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls .


We took a PS3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free . There &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot; And now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .

I love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room . Anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes . And this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .


And he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was . And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital . We kicked his bed so that he could see out .
And he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
Thank you guys very much . That was awesome . And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
The funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too . And after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , carb-fest and all-night sessions , Tony drew again for the first time in seven years . So there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .

So at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; That was the first time I &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years . And after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , carb-fest and all-night sessions , Tony drew again for the first time in seven years .

The funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too . So that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
So at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; That was the first time I &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years . And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more . That &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .



This is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch .



So we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger . And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more . And &quot; Art of the Streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- Banksy , Shepard Fairey , KAWS -- all of these guys will be there .








So basically this is my point : If you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible . I &apos;m not a programmer , never done anything with ocular recognition technology , but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .











That &apos;s a painting of a circle .



She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge . I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life . About three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , Mrs. Posten , who said , &quot; I need to see you .






About three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , Mrs. Posten , who said , &quot; I need to see you .

We found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
We took a look at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice . I &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults . And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer , and I &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;





It also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out . It needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
It also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out . And you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .




Imagine a plane full of smoke . Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft .
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft . Imagine a plane full of smoke .


I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants . Imagine a plane full of smoke .
You could see Manhattan . The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River . That &apos;s usually not the route .











Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I &apos;m opening it . I no longer want to postpone anything in life .


And that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life . I no longer want to postpone anything in life .
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I &apos;m opening it . And that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life . I learned that it all changes in an instant .



And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter . The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge , which was by not a lot -- I thought about , wow , I really feel one real regret . And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
It &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better . In my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried .

And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people . I &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .




It &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better . The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
And after , as I reflected on that , I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life . It &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better . It feels great .


I don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those documentaries . And as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary . It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot; You can see the water coming . I no longer try to be right ; I choose to be happy .
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives . I didn &apos;t want to go ; I love my life . I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
And as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary . The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot; I didn &apos;t want to go ; I love my life .
And as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary . I don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those documentaries . You can see the water coming .




About a month later , I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader , not much artistic talent ... And it made all the sense in the world to me . Above all , above all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad .





I realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad . I challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ? How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ? What would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ? I was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .

I challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ? What would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?




Writing books is my profession but it &apos;s more than that , of course . And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this memoir called &quot; Eat , Pray , Love &quot; which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing . But , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .

Seriously -- doomed , doomed ! But it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a teenager , when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction . Like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
So that &apos;s reassuring , you know . And people would say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?

Aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot; Like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ? And people would say , &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?

Aren &apos;t you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ? The result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I &apos;m doomed . Aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot;





And I &apos;m afraid of many , many more things besides that people can &apos;t even guess at , like seaweed and other things that are scary .

Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things . Aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? &quot; Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .

Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do . Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ? But , when it comes to writing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?

We writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable . Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ? &quot; That chemical-engineering block , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ? But we don &apos;t even blink when we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish . And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other careers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?

I think it &apos;s odious .

And I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it perpetuated into the next century .


I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
And it &apos;s exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ? And I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that I &apos;m in right now in my career .

I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .

That &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there . I should just put it bluntly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me . And it &apos;s exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?

I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on . And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .

I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on . And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?

And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity . But , ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , OK ? And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .


People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
So brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work . And everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ? The Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
But , ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , OK ? So the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ? People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .

The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity &quot; daemons . &quot; People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ? The Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius . Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .

The Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius . And then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine . Which is great , because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .


And for the first time in history , you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius , rather than having a genius . And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time . And it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .



It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance . And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .




It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance . It &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun . Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .

And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years . It just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance . You know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
Maybe not . I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this . And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery . And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically , fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff . I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery . Maybe not . And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?

But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ? Can we do this differently ? And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically , fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .


I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who &apos;s now in her 90s , but she &apos;s been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape . A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally . And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically , fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .

A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally . Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .





And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot; She would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page . And she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it . And she said it was like a thunderous train of air . And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot; And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape . And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .


She would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pipeline ! You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify . And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another poet . &quot;
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s uncanny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like . You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify . And in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .

You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify . I &apos;m a mule , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly . And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .

But even I , in my mulishness , even I have brushed up against that thing , at times .




And he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it . You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify . I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
But then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles , and this is when it all changed for him .

He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel . But then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles , and this is when it all changed for him . He just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; Excuse me , can you not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
And he &apos;s speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , it &apos;s gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it . So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be haunted by this song forever . He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pencil , or a tape recorder .
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?

But the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing . He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel . Not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
Go bother Leonard Cohen . &quot; If you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , go bother somebody else today . And his whole work process changed after that . When I heard that story , it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already saved me once .

But the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this internalized , tormented thing . It could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration , kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite Tom . It saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; Eat , Pray , Love , &quot; and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .

I &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job . But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it . But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .

If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal . But every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent . But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
And I said aloud , &quot; Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ? So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .


He would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity . Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn . And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
They were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?

But every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent . He would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity . And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot;

And maybe nobody will ever chant God &apos;s name again as he spins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ? But , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it &apos;s Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &apos;s no longer a glimpse of God . In Spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Allah , olé , olé , Allah , magnificent , bravo , &quot; incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to ascend to that height again . But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else . But , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it &apos;s Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &apos;s no longer a glimpse of God .
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life . Which is great , because we need that . But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
But , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it &apos;s Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he &apos;s no longer a glimpse of God . This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success . But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .

But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .




And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is don &apos;t be afraid . Don &apos;t be daunted . Just do your job .
And if not , do your dance anyhow . Don &apos;t be daunted . Just do your job . And , you know , if we think about it this way , it starts to change everything .
And &quot; Olé ! &quot; to you , nonetheless . I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .

&quot; Olé ! &quot; to you , nonetheless , just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up .
If your job is to dance , do your dance . And if not , do your dance anyhow .
And &quot; Olé ! &quot; to you , nonetheless . If the divine , cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed , for just one moment through your efforts , then &quot; Olé ! &quot;






But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business . The gray boxes don &apos;t run Windows software ; they are a completely different technology .

The payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished . The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .

But if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business . Now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge . The only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the Windows part , the dropper part , used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities .
So we start with a Windows dropper .


When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
The payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished .




It &apos;s completely directed . So that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is . The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infect is actually running on that target .
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack . The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infect is actually running on that target . So we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;


The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infect is actually running on that target .
So we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one . And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack .
So that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .

So we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one . And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science . And if not , Stuxnet does nothing .
So we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one . Here you see a sample of this actual attack code . They probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
It &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before . So they know everything . They knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator . So we better find out what the target is soon . &quot; And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information .
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .

And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets . We are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .




In order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported . Here you see a sample of this actual attack code . Now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
In order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported . Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language . So what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .


So we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove . And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data . And then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets .


And I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data . In order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported . It basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant .
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures . So for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .



So we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control . And it even got better . So that made sense , that was a match .

An almost identical structure .
I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges . The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures . So for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .



And guess what we found in the attack code ? And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at . These centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .




So again , that was a real good match .
So we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet .
Down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifuges . Anyway , so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target , but from different angles . So we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet .





And as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet .
Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .

Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data . So it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist , the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video .
The idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room . Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data . The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough . So this is where we need digital safety systems . And as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet .
So this is where we need digital safety systems . The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .

We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough . The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system . It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough . The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system . That &apos;s scary .
The idea is to circumvent a digital safety system . And this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say . So this is where we need digital safety systems .
And when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen . And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it . So for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .

And when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen . Your plant can blow up . And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .


It is generic . So it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory . You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .

And you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet .
Think about this : this attack is generic . You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading . And you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet .

And you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet . Just spread it as wide as possible . So unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East .
They &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
And you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet . You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
We have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
We have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now . And if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction . That &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .

And if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction . I &apos;ve got a question . That &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
That &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .






Ralph , it &apos;s been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this .
Yeah . Okay . Okay , you really want to hear that ? Is that your opinion ?
So the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower . Because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger . My opinion is that the Mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not Israel .


And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous . I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous . So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship , I knew I would want to do something a little different .
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous . I went to prison -- difficult . And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous . And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .

I sent out some Facebook messages , some Twitter messages , and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk .
I sent out some Facebook messages , some Twitter messages , and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk . So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship , I knew I would want to do something a little different . You know how many people watch these TED Talks ?




And as I said earlier , I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .




these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever .
Now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty . You see , I had this idea for a movie . So what happens in &quot; The Greatest Movie Ever Sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is branded from beginning to end -- from the above-the-title sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand X.
But in the new project that I &apos;m working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising . What I want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising. these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever .


these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever . It was , &quot; In perpetuity . Forever . &quot;
And so the film explores this whole idea -- It &apos;s what ? In perpetuity , forever ? It was , &quot; In perpetuity . Forever . &quot; So the movie will be called &quot; The Greatest Movie Ever Sold . &quot;

And so the film explores this whole idea -- It &apos;s what ? In perpetuity , forever ? these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever . Now this brand , the Qualcomm Stadium , the Staples Center ...
So the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
the greatest car you ever drove from &quot; The Greatest Movie Ever Sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , courtesy of &quot; The Greatest Movie Ever Sold . &quot; The goal of this whole film is transparency . And actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
And actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
So the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ? So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... You &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
So that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish . You &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie . And actually we show the whole process of how does it work .








I don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it , though . But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?


But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ? How much money does it take to do this ? I think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but I think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .


What do you think the response is going to be ? Who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of blithering idiots . The responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
JK : Both . We &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands . Yeah .





I can help you .


Turns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot; Turn the camera off .


They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project . Turns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot; I was amazed .
And I was blown away , because I thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible . And just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared . None of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie . But the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this . Actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .




So I like the way you roll , Sergey Brin . No . But the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .

That wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all . But what this image represents was the problem . Actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .

But what this image represents was the problem . Actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever . But the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .




But why ? Well , transparency is scary -- like that odd , still-screaming bear . And it &apos;s also very risky . See , when you do a Google image search for transparency , this is --- This is one of the first images that comes up .
It &apos;s unpredictable -- like this odd country road .
What else is risky ? This is was the problem : transparency -- free from pretense or deceit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem . But why ? Well , transparency is scary -- like that odd , still-screaming bear .
That &apos;s very risky . What else is risky ? You see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
That &apos;s very risky . And it &apos;s also very risky . Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip .

And it &apos;s also very risky . What else is risky ? But why ? Well , transparency is scary -- like that odd , still-screaming bear .


Now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .

There &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot; Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; No , we want you to tell a story .
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; No , we want you to tell a story . So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .

And then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant Hollywood movies ? &quot; And the friends of mine who make big , giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
I have friends who make great big , giant Hollywood films , and I have friends who make little independent films like I make . And then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant Hollywood movies ? &quot; So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .

So we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents . Whether it &apos;s a &quot; Floral Fusion &quot; or a &quot; Paradise Winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance . So maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
Whether it &apos;s a &quot; Floral Fusion &quot; or a &quot; Paradise Winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance . While anytime I do an interview with someone , I can say , &quot; Are you fresh enough for this interview ? And the movie is called &quot; The Greatest Movie Ever Sold . &quot;


We will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll-on or stick , whatever it may be . We are a smaller brand . Whether it &apos;s a &quot; Floral Fusion &quot; or a &quot; Paradise Winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .




So we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have . Much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challenger brand . We will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll-on or stick , whatever it may be .
We are a smaller brand . So we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have . What are the words that you would use to describe Ban ?
We are a smaller brand .
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challenger brand . So we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have . We are a smaller brand .





How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher . I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wetness . &quot; It keeps you fresh .
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher . I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wetness . &quot; We talk about bold , fresh .
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit . They need to tell me about my brand . And that &apos;s a multi-million dollar corporation .
I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wetness . &quot;

How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher . I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wetness . &quot; I need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular Joes .





I like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that . All right , what is brand Gerry ?
I like really nice clothes .


I like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .

I like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .

I guess what kind of genre , style I am would be like dark glamor . But usually I have an accessory , like sunglasses , or I like crystal and things like that too . I sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .

I sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world . So I guess that &apos;s my brand .
I &apos;m the pet guy . If Dan were a brand , he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz . In my warped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .

Part hippie , part yogi , part Brooklyn girl -- I don &apos;t know . I &apos;m Tom .






I needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand personality . &quot; And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg . If they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .



Well we can &apos;t all be brand Tom , but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly . I did . The very first picture is a picture of my family . And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg .
If they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me . And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg . I did . The very first picture is a picture of my family .







What &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?


It &apos;s like , who do I want to be ? How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?



What are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ? ... Doesn &apos;t have to be fear . What kind of roller coaster are you on ?


Tell me a little bit about that part . Yeah , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .












And you can see here too , Target , Wii , Mini from the Mini Coopers , and JetBlue . What other brands are like that ? If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
Most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &apos;s a neat thing to see . Now there &apos;s playful brands and mindful brands , those things that have come and gone , but a playful , mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing . If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?

Now there &apos;s playful brands and mindful brands , those things that have come and gone , but a playful , mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing . Up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the Fresh Prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like Errol Flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like Gandalf . Are you something that &apos;s a little more calm , reserved , conservative ?

Or are you more of a down attribute ? Or are you more of a down attribute ?
Are you an up attribute ? Are you something that gets the blood flowing ? Or are you more of a down attribute ?
Are you established , traditional , nurturing , protective , empathetic like the Oprah ? Or are you more of a down attribute ? Are you an up attribute ? Are you something that gets the blood flowing ?
A playful , mindful brand . What is your brand ? If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
Are you an up attribute ? Are you something that gets the blood flowing ?

Or are you more of a down attribute ?
Are you established , traditional , nurturing , protective , empathetic like the Oprah ? Are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda ?

Up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the Fresh Prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like Errol Flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like Gandalf . Are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
Up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the Fresh Prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like Errol Flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like Gandalf .

Are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ? Are you established , traditional , nurturing , protective , empathetic like the Oprah ? In the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no billboards , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no fliers , nothing .
Are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda ?
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
In the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no billboards , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no fliers , nothing . And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America . Over the course of this film , we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising . What &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that I &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or I &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where I &apos;ve interacted with things directly .
They wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product . They cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; Maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind . But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .




Well , since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival , let &apos;s take a look . According to Burrelles , the movie premiered in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film . I &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
And that &apos;s what these brands did . They cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; Maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind . The film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .


And how has that been for them ? Has it been successful ? It &apos;s not even online . It &apos;s not even streaming . According to Burrelles , the movie premiered in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
According to Burrelles , the movie premiered in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film . That &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half-week period . Well , since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival , let &apos;s take a look .
It &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet . And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part . That &apos;s only online -- no print , no TV .
That &apos;s only online -- no print , no TV . The film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet . According to Burrelles , the movie premiered in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
The film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .

The film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet . So ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum . It &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .




One big spoonful at a time , we have to embrace risk . And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part . I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse , then you &apos;re preparing your whole company to be reward challenged .


Ultimately , moving forward , I think we have to embrace fear . We &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage . We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them .
Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world . And ultimately , we have to embrace transparency . And that being said , through honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; Embrace Transparency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC , who for $ 7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay .

And that being said , through honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; Embrace Transparency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC , who for $ 7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay .










And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together . And I grew up in India . I had a great education -- I &apos;m not complaining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .



I had a great education -- I &apos;m not complaining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks . And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .


Two ways of going in -- very simple . You look around at all these museums here . Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .


So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.

Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump . So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com. You want to navigate around the museum ?


Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump . Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum . You move around , you have fun .

It doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .


Keep going . Have fun . So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; The Harvesters &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met . Now this is one of the images .
Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part . So this is all of the meta-data information . Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the meta-data information . For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I &apos;m going to click this off right now . If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .



Now this is one of the images . You can zoom around very simply . I see this plus sign .

So this is all of the meta-data information . You can zoom around very simply . I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .

And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology . So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels . So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .


You can zoom around very simply . And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot; I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .

And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here . I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday . And apparently it was quite popular . I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .

And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here . I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday . Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .

Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get . So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York . So another one of my favorites , &quot; The Starry Night . &quot;




Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks . Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get . Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ? You zoom in . You really go in . This is &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; I think , never seen like this before .

Now the example I showed you was all about finding details . But what if you want to see brush strokes ? And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
You zoom in . You really go in .

I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks . And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ? Any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks . I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature . And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images . Very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around . You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .

Any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter . So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google . Very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around .

I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists . Very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around .
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images . It really comes from these artists . I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .











So where would you put your brain on this scale ? And for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical . Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time .

You can be logical and intuitive . This would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive . This is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
There &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive . You can be logical and intuitive . And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain .

And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain . So where would you put your brain on this scale ?

This would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive . But at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work . And for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .


It &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything . So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time . Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time .

You can be logical and intuitive .

So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
It &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles . How do we develop this intuition ? Well we like to play with stuff . But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .

It &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles . And when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time . And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
But you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us . It &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles . But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist . And so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles . This didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often .


But you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .





This didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often . Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ? I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .


Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?



And then here &apos;s a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal .



So what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sticking out over a ledge . And then here &apos;s a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal . And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
So what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sticking out over a ledge . And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip . I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer , and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
And then here &apos;s a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal .



So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way . And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip . I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer , and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room . For the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device . This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
We turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down Now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ? The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ? I mean , when I &apos;m in an elevator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them . And so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers .


And by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .

Instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows . We turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down Now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted . What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
So in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down . And so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers . And by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .

And by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .



And by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics . The rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized . So in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .

So in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .

I mean , this is just my logical side talking . It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you . So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?


So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ? And so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space . That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places .
And so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space . You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected . I mean , this is just my logical side talking .

It &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics . You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
So imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ? How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ? It &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .

It &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
It &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .

Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
In 2007 , I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development .





Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet . But you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way . Now this might sound preposterous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
But just substitute apartment building for cities . Now this might sound preposterous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities . So we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .

But you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way . So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities . Later I learned that at about this same time , Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras .

You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments . So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities . At one point , Javier said to Octavio , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy ; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;
Later I learned that at about this same time , Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras . At the next regularly scheduled election , Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well . At one point , Javier said to Octavio , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy ; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;



At the next regularly scheduled election , Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well . Through a process of refinement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials . So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities .

Later I learned that at about this same time , Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras .
At one point , Javier said to Octavio , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy ; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot; He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff . In the summer of 2009 , Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis .





He showed it to Javier . They said , &quot; Let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot; So in December we met in Miami , in a hotel conference room .

In the fall of 2010 , a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk . They said , &quot; Let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot; They called me .
But it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , Octavio said , &quot; Paul , maybe we could watch the TEDTalk . &quot; He showed it to Javier .
So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big . I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost . So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .

So in December we met in Miami , in a hotel conference room . So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country . I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .

So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers . This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers . That &apos;s more than 250 hundred-thousand acres .
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .

I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth .
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country . So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .

The leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &quot; Professor Romer , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk . The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive . So I sat down , and they played the TEDTalk .






And it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .



We went and looked at a site .
To be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress . In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one . And shortly thereafter , on January 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .


In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one . On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one . And shortly thereafter , on January 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .
On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one . This is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston . In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one .
To be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress . In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one . It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .




One is South Korea . They &apos;ve actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third . This is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston .
So if you think about this practically , here &apos;s where we are . The other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is Singapore . Everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the permits .


One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there . They &apos;ve actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third .

There &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there . One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there . They &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .

Sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade . One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there . Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .



Sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade . So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras ? What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?

And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you , TED .

Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ? I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day . And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week .
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ? Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ? And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time . Each task was made up of many , many , many sub-choices of course . And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week .




Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?







So when I ask you a question , since I &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories .

Now as I talk about this problem , I &apos;m going to have some questions for you and I &apos;m going to want to know your answers .

So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very upscale grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly upscale . I used to love going to this store , but on one occasion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ? It was a store called Draeger &apos;s .






I used to love going to this store , but on one occasion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ? So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and I asked the manager , &quot; Is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot; We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store .


They had 348 different kinds of jam . So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and I asked the manager , &quot; Is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot; Now we see the opposite effect .
More people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent . Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam . Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .




Now we see the opposite effect . Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam . Now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam . Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam . Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow . Now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman , Emir Kamenica , Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S.

And what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .




And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow . So in these plans , we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings . In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile .

So if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be . And what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate . So in these plans , we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds . In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile . So if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
So if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be . Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences . And what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .

Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences . Well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices . So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .

Well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices . They &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest .


People are always upset when I say , &quot; Cut . &quot;

The first : Cut . But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience . They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
People are always upset when I say , &quot; Cut . &quot; So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
The first : Cut . People are always upset when I say , &quot; Cut . &quot;



Now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard . You know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products . For those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
You know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products . The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products . But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .


Now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard . And if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot; The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
Now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard . And the first thing I do is I ask the employees , &quot; Tell me how these choices are different from one another .


They &apos;re all important choices . &quot; Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund .
And now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take Gary up on his offer .



Okay . Anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer . Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip . Now before we started our session this afternoon , I had a chat with Gary .
And now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take Gary up on his offer . Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .



All right , let me show you some more about this . And now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take Gary up on his offer . You guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .


Because the pictures made it feel more real to you . Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money . That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .


And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more . Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .


The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more . That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way . Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .

The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more . The third technique : Categorization .
And during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing . And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more . By doing that simple thing , there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .









One is called &quot; Jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; Swing . &quot; The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing , but you know what ? If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing , clap your hands .

The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing , but you know what ? One is called &quot; Jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; Swing . &quot; If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz , clap your hands .


If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing , clap your hands . If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz , clap your hands . This is a highly useless categorization scheme .
Who are they actually supposed to be informing ? And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds . The categories need to say something to the chooser , not the choice-maker .


It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier . We have to gradually increase the complexity . My fourth technique : Condition for complexity .

My fourth technique : Condition for complexity .


My fourth technique : Condition for complexity . We have to gradually increase the complexity .
You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
Here &apos;s a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car . It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier . I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .

You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car . Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision . I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .


So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear . Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four gearshifts . So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear . What am I going to look at ?

If you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means I &apos;m losing you . It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices . What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again .
We &apos;re losing them .

If you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means I &apos;m losing you .
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again . We &apos;re losing them . How engaged you are .

It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices . Even though choosing gearshift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor , it still prepares me for how to choose . If you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means I &apos;m losing you .
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again . Even though choosing gearshift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor , it still prepares me for how to choose . It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices .

If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose . It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices . I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .



Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing . All of these techniques that I &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving . I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ; concretize -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .





Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday . We all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do . But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute .
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture . We all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do . And of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .

But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute .









And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact . In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times . He just wanted to share a rainbow .

But he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , Bear . In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times . Because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear .



And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January . And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
So what happened here ? Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become . It &apos;s Friday , Friday . Gotta get down on Friday . Everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . Friday , Friday . Gettin &apos; down on Friday . So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .


Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become . And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year . Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .


And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also Fridays . This is a chart of what it looked like . So what happened on this day ?

But what about this day , this one particular Friday ? So what happened on this day ? Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter .
Well it was a Friday , this is true .
Well it was a Friday , this is true . And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also Fridays . And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .





And now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
And if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times . And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it . It &apos;s this , just like this .


So &quot; Nyan Cat &quot; is a looped animation with looped music . Even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week . Someone made an old timey version .
And then it went international . Cats were watching other cats watch this video . There were remixes .
Even cats were watching this video . But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky Internet culture . An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .





An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of . Someone made an old timey version . But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky Internet culture .

And who could have predicted any of this ? In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have . By being totally surprising and humorous , Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .

By being totally surprising and humorous , Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times . Who could have predicted &quot; Double Rainbow &quot; or Rebecca Black or &quot; Nyan Cat ? &quot;
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .

In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have . When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested . So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
Tastemakers , creative participating communities , complete unexpectedness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .

It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .


Let me tell you about some of the pieces .

He retreated into silence . He died broken by history . Words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .

My grandmother never let me forget his life . But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life . I never knew him in real life . My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .



My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured . For her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia . But our lives are much more than our memories .


It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed . For her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .

For her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea . If we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink . All the adults knew the risks .



The greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death . So after a four-year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel . I don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .

My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon . But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .










My mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts . Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence I was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray . All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
Two pairs of stockings for school , each to hide the holes in the other . And there were rare but searing chants of &quot; slit-eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again . Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications . All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .

Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications .
And there were rare but searing chants of &quot; slit-eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot; My mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house . My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .



My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her .



Centers were established . But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Australian of the year . In one , I was the classic Asian student , relentless in the demands that I made on myself . Grants and sponsors were sought .
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit . She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business .
Tan Le , anonymous Footscray resident , was now Tan Le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined . And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds . I lived in parallel worlds .

I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything . I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .




And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat . &quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;

No had never been an option .




Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province .
At the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared . And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .


Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through . There was an energy there , an implacable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .


I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge . Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through . At the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .

She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered . Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through . Three months later I had relocated , and the adventure has continued .

Before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother . At the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.

Three months later I had relocated , and the adventure has continued .






A few days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket . At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her . I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .



She asked the monk , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot; At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket .

&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
She asked the monk , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot; &quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said . &quot; You have not let it go . &quot;





Who could ever wish it on their own ? Can I give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ? Yet I am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .

But if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .
But if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would . Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat . Given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us .


Can I give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ? Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .





Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .

Or is it photography ? It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .

It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .



And despite that , it retains a level of realism .



Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph . But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism . Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism . Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .


Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick . So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really . Is it something about the details or the colors ?


Is it something about the details or the colors ? I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .


But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist . It &apos;s just really about combining different realities . And I see the same process with combining photographs .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .

And I see the same process with combining photographs . So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow . So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .

So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result . But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
And I see the same process with combining photographs . So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective . Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives . So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective . And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
But combined , they can create something like this . The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .

Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed . So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .

Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated . So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically . I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .


And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish . So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .

But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations . Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs . And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs . The shores are from a different location .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip . The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic . The underwater part was captured in a stone pit . So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .


So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning . It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .


And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail , since we stopped listening . I would like to talk to you about why many e-health projects fail . And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer .
And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail , since we stopped listening . And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .


And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients . And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer .

And every morning I hop on it . And one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer .
But the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I hop on , it sends my data through Google Health as well .

And yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see . And it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it , but also looking backward .
And every morning I hop on it . So every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lucien . &quot; It &apos;s got one knob , on / off .



But the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I hop on , it sends my data through Google Health as well .

But that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients . And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars . And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
Make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team . And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars . And you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .

We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone . But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient ? And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
We &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED was to be obtained right now . But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient ? And sure , we could find fast food chains .
We know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht . So what we did , we crowdsourced The Netherlands . And you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
We set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see an AED , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course . The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are . We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .

And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands already have been submitted . We set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see an AED , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course . The next step we took was to find the applications for it .

We made an application for Layar , augmented reality , to find these AEDs . And as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as AED4EU , which is what the product is called , but also AED4US . And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .

And we built an iPad application . And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest AED which can save lives . And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
That whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .

And &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world . The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs .

Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot; This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome . &quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .



We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been digitizing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life . We &apos;ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer . So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .

When we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell . We &apos;ve been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;


And if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ? And so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ? A chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve . So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions . When we look at its metabolic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?

A chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material . And so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ? And if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?

So , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .


There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .

The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .

The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli . It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria . But we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it &apos;s over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .

It &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
They laughed more than you guys are . And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .

When we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .

And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .

They laughed more than you guys are . And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .

Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together . You may have read that we put watermarks in . Initially , all we did was autograph it .

So we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts . When we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs . Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
Think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- A , C , G and T. We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together . Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there &apos;s a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
At each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robust that you can see in a minute . We design unique elements into this . And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .

And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .

When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow readily in E. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms . We knew there &apos;s a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together . We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .



Twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .

When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow readily in E. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms . Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation . These organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .

In fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there . Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation . This is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .



It &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
It &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope . This is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph . Well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? How do we activate this ?


With bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it . It &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope . It &apos;s also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cloning .
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure . With bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it . We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .

This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure . If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .

Well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? How do we activate this ? Obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .

This is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome . It &apos;s also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cloning . The chromosome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species . And with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell . It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .

It turned blue because of the genes we put in it .

And with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell . All the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had transferred in . It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .

And I &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speciation based on this digital design .
So , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs . We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .

We &apos;re limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination . We now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combinatorial genomics . There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .



When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge . When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science . We now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combinatorial genomics .

We &apos;re focusing on now fourth-generation fuels . We &apos;re limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination . You know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science . But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road . We now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combinatorial genomics .
And we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months . We have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .

Sunlight and CO2 is one method ... We &apos;re looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process . You &apos;ve seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .


And we think we &apos;ll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months . It lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .

Here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes . I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .

And my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...

It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do . We &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
Okay . Oh , that &apos;s all my time ? It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .



Okay . Thank you very much .






So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government . But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today . We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .

Here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow . Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ? Instead of sending them off into the Third World , we send them into the wilds of City Hall .

Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston . And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants . Instead of sending them off into the Third World , we send them into the wilds of City Hall .
And there they make great apps , they work with city staffers . We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program . But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .

We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program . And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
But one fellow in particular , a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things . We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program . They were there in February , and it snowed a lot in February last year .

They were there in February , and it snowed a lot in February last year . If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al . And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .


It &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant . This is a modest little app . And if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
It &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant . It &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year . So it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
This is a modest little app . So it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it . If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .





There &apos;s a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens . So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them . And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this . There &apos;s a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .

And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .




If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes . Procuring software usually takes a couple of years .



And there are projects like this at every level of government . And that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative . And that &apos;s nothing .

And that &apos;s nothing .
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government . It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should . And not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
Now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively . It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should . And there are projects like this at every level of government .

But what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution , but as a problem of collective action . It &apos;s not just Code for America fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities . And that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
And that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of Tim O &apos;Reilly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot; And that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .

It &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city . This is the call center for the services and information line . And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .

Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about opossums . He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control . And because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .


Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about opossums . He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control . If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .

So Scott gets this call . If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house . It has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Citizens Connect .

It has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Citizens Connect . This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston . So that worked . So booya for Scott .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .

It has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Citizens Connect . Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center . But on Citizens Connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .

So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; Opossum in my trashcan . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead . But on Citizens Connect everything is public , so everybody can see this . And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .

So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; Opossum in my trashcan . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .

But on Citizens Connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
Turned trashcan on its side . Walked home . Goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .
Goodnight sweet opossum . &quot; So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical . And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .


And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here . And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game . But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform . So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical . And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game . So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform . So one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here . So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .

I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . When one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities . And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
And it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services . So one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here . When one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
It connected those two people . And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .

It connected those two people .


Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics . And most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other . And what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
When one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities . That &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six-inch layer on top . And most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .


But it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re disempowering ourselves .
Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
If we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
People seem to think politics is sexy .


If we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy . We have to engage with the machinery of government . You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .




Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children . The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society . Now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so I am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
Now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so I am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them .

Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children . We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective . That &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .


And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way . So when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices . Now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so I am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them .

Now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so I am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them . So when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices . They &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted . And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way . They &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
They &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better . And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better . So when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .


Thank you . So the question I have for all of you here : When it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ? But these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .







Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .


And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about . What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it . And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves .
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves . In other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file . What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it . And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve . Now why do we draw technology curves in semi-log curves ?


And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi-log curve . Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly . They sort of go like this .

And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi-log curves . Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line . Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .

Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly . So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
It &apos;s not moving like that . Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever . And there &apos;s nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .

Either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this . Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi-log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line . So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .


If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition . But when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing . Now I &apos;m an optimist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .

Now I &apos;m an optimist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that . That &apos;s about all it can do . Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .

Either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this . One of two things is going to happen . What &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?



And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ? We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .


Now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all . Because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .

That transition is happening . We can all sense it .

So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .






And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them . Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .

So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time . So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it . And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .


Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction . And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil . And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
And those that were like that started to split and divide . And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil . But now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .

And every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them . And those that were like that started to split and divide . But now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
So in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied . And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil . And every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
But now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals . In fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more . And every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction . They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA . So in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .

In fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing . The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago . In fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .




In fact , one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .


But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells . But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times . And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .

But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times . Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .

Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were synergistic . I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .

But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
And at that stage , we have multi-cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism . Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate . We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .

And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community . And at that stage , we have multi-cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
And at that stage , we have multi-cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism . And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years . We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years . And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-cellular community . We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .

And in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information . And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community . So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
And in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information . So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up . And those are the neural structures .
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities . So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up . Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .

Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span . So an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it . So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit . So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , Because evolution could now happen within an individual . And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .

I &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it . But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
Here I have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
Here I have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head . I &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
We &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information . And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out . And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .

And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out . Telephony , computers , videotapes , CD-ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information . I &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .


So now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
So now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again . And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before . And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years . Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
So now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds . The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change . And these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years . And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years . And these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .




The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change . And these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades . And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .

The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .




So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .



One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself . Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot; So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions . So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
Say , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions . So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot; And I say , &quot; Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job . So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers . But one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best . Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with . And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best . Say , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .

So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best . So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .

So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers . And let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &quot; So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best . Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs . So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .

Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs . And let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &quot;
Introduce some mutations perhaps . And try that again and do that for another generation . So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best . At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers . Say , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot;
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job . Score them again . Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .


I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work . Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand . I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work . So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds . At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers . So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .

Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work . At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers . They &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this .




And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .


In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated . We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster . So we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .

So it &apos;s feeding back on itself . So we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering . The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so confusing .

Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves . So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster . So we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .


Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves . We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .




So we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating . But I think that there really is something coming along after us . And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms .

Now we do the same with airplanes . Back then , when Arjuna , the great Indian warrior prince , when he was thirsty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out . So back in the day , when us Indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .




So back in the day , when us Indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky . And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic &quot; The Mahabharata . &quot;

And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic &quot; The Mahabharata . &quot; I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .





It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination . And it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it . I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .
And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me . When I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch . I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .
When I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
And so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world . So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming . And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .

It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch . And so I jumped in , I jumped into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it . And this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .

It can know where we are . And so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .


It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch . And so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world . So it says , &quot; Place your fingers upon each light . &quot;

Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial . And so -- It says , &quot; This box belongs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name . At various points , a little letter drops down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addressed to me .

So I &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch Khoya , an interactive app for the iPad .

And actually I become a character in the book .

And so over here you need to tilt your iPad , take the fireflies out .

The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device . And I don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children . And it opens up a map .
This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book . And so over here you need to tilt your iPad , take the fireflies out . And I don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children .

All along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static . This idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me . And I don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children .
Another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary . And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book . So I &apos;m just going to enter in .


And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device .
And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device . And it opens up a map . So we &apos;ve all heard about fairies and we &apos;ve all heard about nymphs , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts , the Apsaras ?
So we &apos;ve all heard about fairies and we &apos;ve all heard about nymphs , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts , the Apsaras ? And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis . These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book .
All along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .

Speaking of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their PCs , they haven &apos;t been able to get out . And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis . But now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .

So in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .



In another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that . One of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects .

And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .

I spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness . And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .




And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful . And sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t . And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .
I spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row . If you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things . And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
And one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity . And being here at TED and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .

If you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .


I actually learned about this from my grandmother . And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful . And so I want to talk about the power of identity .





She was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world . Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840 &apos;s . I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .


When I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs . And an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot;


When I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs . And my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .


And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her . And she &apos;d squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go . And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .

And I would look at her and I &apos;d smile , but she was very serious . And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .




And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Bryan . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot; And I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around . And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .

And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Bryan . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot; She took me out back and she said , &quot; Bryan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot; She said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; Sure . &quot;

Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot; And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Bryan . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot; And I would look at her and I &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .

She took me out back and she said , &quot; Bryan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot; She said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot; And she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;

She said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot; Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot; I never will forget it .




Then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot; And then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Bryan . &quot;


Then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot; She said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot; She said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;

Then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot; She said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot; She said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;

Well I adored my mom , so I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot; Well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot; And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .




Then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you . &quot; And then my brother started staring at me .


Then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you . &quot;





But I &apos;m 52 years old , and I &apos;m going to admit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol . I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t . I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s virtuous ; I say that because there is power in identity .

And I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
And I &apos;m going to admit something to you . I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t . We can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .














Our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty . Wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .





The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .

It &apos;s interesting to me .
We &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work . And yet , we seem to be very comfortable . My state of Alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction .

Right now in Alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote . We &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act .

And there is this stunning silence . My state of Alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction .

We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country . I represent children . The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .

Death penalty in America is defined by error . It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating . It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty . And that &apos;s a very sensible question .

A kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
For every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row . Death penalty in America is defined by error . The other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .

It &apos;s not our struggle . It &apos;s not our problem . It &apos;s not our burden .



I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill . I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II . And it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about African American history , I tell them about slavery .
In many communities , people had to worry about being lynched . But for African Americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror . It &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues . I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II .

And these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot; But for African Americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .


I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II . And that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid . It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
But for African Americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror . I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II . They had to worry about being bombed .

We &apos;re constantly running into each other . And these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot; We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .





We &apos;re constantly running into each other . In Rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .






And the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .

And yet , in this country , in the states of the Old South , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched . What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately Jewish ? He said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death penalty in Germany .

It would be unconscionable for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &quot; He said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death penalty in Germany .


It would be unconscionable for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &quot; What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately Jewish ?


But ultimately , those realities are shadowed by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
We love technology . We love creativity . We love entertainment .

We love technology . We love creativity . We love innovation .
You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen . Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world . And for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
But ultimately , those realities are shadowed by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen . And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to TED . But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .

And for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two . And it &apos;s that mind-heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things , but also the dark and difficult things . And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to TED .


Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in . You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen . And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to TED .
There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to unfairness , to injustice . But thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart . Innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone . We do . As rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .



And it &apos;s that mind-heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things , but also the dark and difficult things .

And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott -- amazing African American woman -- and Virginia Durr , a white woman , whose husband , Clifford Durr , represented Dr. King . Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in . And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk . And I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , Ma &apos;am , I do . &quot; And she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;


I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot; And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen . And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .

And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot; And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen . And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot; Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot; And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Bryan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is .
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Bryan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is . We &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice . We &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice . And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Bryan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot; And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Bryan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is . Tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
We &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice . We &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty . And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Bryan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is .

We &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty . I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice . We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .







And that &apos;s when Ms. Carr leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot; that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done . We need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .


It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .

I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth . And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law . Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief . I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer . And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar . I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar . I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief . And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .

I believe that for every person on the planet . And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .

I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
Because it &apos;s in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are . Ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated . And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .



I sometimes push too hard . Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
I sometimes push too hard .
How can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ? And the judge has certified him as an adult , but I see this kid .

And the judge has certified him as an adult , but I see this kid .


And I go to the jail and I see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
Yeah , Bryan , the judge has some magic power . I start thinking , well , how did that happen ? And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white 75-year-old corporate executive . &quot;
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power . How can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ? I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?

And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power . Yeah , Bryan , the judge has some magic power . And I had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white 75-year-old corporate executive . &quot;
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power . And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct . Yeah , Bryan , the judge has some magic power .
And because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion . Yeah , Bryan , the judge has some magic power . And I finally decided , oh gosh , I &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
And the next morning , I woke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ? And I finally decided , oh gosh , I &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
And to my horror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court . And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white 75-year-old corporate executive . &quot; And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct .
And the next morning , I woke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ? There was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct .
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse . There was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct . And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct .
And the next morning , I woke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?













Well I went into the courtroom .
I had written these crazy things . And I have to tell you , it was energizing . He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And as soon as I walked inside , the judge saw me coming in . Well I went into the courtroom . He said , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
And before I knew it , the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality . I said , &quot; Yes , sir . I did . &quot; And we started arguing . He said , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;

And people started coming in because they were just outraged .


And he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler . And finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table . About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .


That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity . I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice . He said , &quot; Jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? &quot;
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot; And finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .

And yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest . If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment . There &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment . For example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars . And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .

Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable . The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories . That &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
There &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades . And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates . It was this misguided war on drugs .
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates . And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized .

What would you say to someone who believed that ?
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less . The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories . And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .


And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one . I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less . And I think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized .
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment . I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less .

Thank you so much for coming to TED . Thank you . Bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here . I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less .




Drug war . Mass destruction . Tornado . Recession . Default . Doomsday . Egypt . Syria . Tsunami warning . Cyber-attacks .
Oh , my God . Recession . Default . Doomsday . Egypt . Syria . Societal decay . 65 dead .




And there &apos;s a very good reason for that .





And because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala . It &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse . Now the amygdala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic . But perhaps that &apos;s not the case . Every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .

So given a dozen news stories , we will preferentially look at the negative news . It &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .

Add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold . Now I &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shortage -- we surely do . Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .

Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 . Steve Pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .

Over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .

Over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled . The wealthiest robber barons of the last century , the emperors on this planet , could have never dreamed of such luxuries . Think of this , in America today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .

Now look at this curve . I want you to notice two things from this curve . And on this curve , riding on Moore &apos;s Law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .

Cloud computing , what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3D printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ; nanomaterials ; and A.I. Number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time . This is Moore &apos;s Law over the last hundred years .

This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers . Number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time . And on this curve , riding on Moore &apos;s Law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .



And I love this : &quot; Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents . &quot;



And we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges . I mean , how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM &apos;s Watson ? Four years ago here at TED , Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University .

And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade . And we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .

30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .

When I think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .





But the King of Siam , he was fed with aluminum utensils .
All of Napoleon &apos;s troops were fed with silver utensils , Napoleon himself with gold utensils . Let me give you an example .






So let &apos;s project this analogy going forward . It &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates . But then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality .


And if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water . We think about energy scarcity . Ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .



For the first time , this year the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India -- 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees . The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year . 16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .



Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth , in 1990 after it just passed Saturn ? And if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .







And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning , one of the great DIY innovators , I &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator . And if that pans out , which I have every confidence it will , Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .

There &apos;s nanotechnology coming on , nanomaterials . Yes , 97.5 percent is saltwater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
And we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones . My goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013 . And there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .



My goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013 . This is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today . And we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .



We &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got A.I. , you can cough on it , you can do a finger blood prick .


Last month , I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $ 10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize . Better than that , the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS , HD video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone . When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .

I call it the rising billion . And by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy . So literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
So the white lines here are population . And by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy . By 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion Internet users .
In 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected . So literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .

Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation . But here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance . What will they consume ? What will they desire ?

In 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
What will they consume ? What will they desire ? In 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .

And they will get healthier by using the Tricorder , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the Khan Academy , and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before . These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy . What will they consume ? What will they desire ?
So what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ? What will these three billion people bring ? Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
So what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ? And rather than having economic shutdown , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
What will these three billion people bring ? What about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ? What will these people want ?


So what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
What will these three billion people bring ?

And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold . It &apos;s a game called Foldit . And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .

Ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet . We have the tools with this exponential technology .




Hey , why not ?
And there &apos;s hundreds of them . We all love baseball , don &apos;t we ? Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .



&quot; Moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team . I &apos;m going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of . And there &apos;s hundreds of them .



That means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
It &apos;s called batting average .
That means hit the ball into the outfield , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe . &quot; Moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team . Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
That means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats . Three times out of 10 . So we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .




Legendary -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season . Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ? Do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball ?
Now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about . Somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ? But , but , you know what ?

Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on angioplasties . Do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ? Legendary -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .

Suppose you have appendicitis and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on appendectomies . Legendary -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .



Somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?


What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an OBGYN , a paramedic is supposed to be ? And she &apos;s hitting a 257 . She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the comeback trail .
And she &apos;s hitting a 257 . What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an OBGYN , a paramedic is supposed to be ?
Somehow this isn &apos;t working . I was an obsessive compulsive student . Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat .

Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat . What do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an OBGYN , a paramedic is supposed to be ? And I studied in my little garret at the nurses &apos; residence at Toronto General Hospital , not far from here .



And I did well , I graduated with honors , cum laude . I was an obsessive compulsive student . And I memorized everything .

I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis . And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes . And it worked for a while , until I met Mrs. Drucker .
I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common . And I memorized everything . And it worked for a while , until I met Mrs. Drucker .

And I saw Mrs. Drucker , and she was breathless .
And it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in emerg . At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation . I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working .

And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope , I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure . I gave her aspirin . I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. and to report back to my attending .



And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope , I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure . This is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shortness of breath . I gave her medications that we call diuretics , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .





And that &apos;s when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him . I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself . I gave her medications that we call diuretics , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .

Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .

Maybe I did it for a good reason . I sent her home without speaking to my attending .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself . I sent her home without speaking to my attending . Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-maintenance resident .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .

And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;


And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot; And I went back to my work on the wards . All the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .






And it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread .
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot; Well she was back all right . &quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .

&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot; And it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread . The three words are : Do you remember ?
Well she was back all right . She was back and near death . The three words are : Do you remember ?
She was back and near death . &quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
Well she was back all right . &quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice . And she was barely breathing and she was blue .
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
About an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock . They put her on a ventilator . She was back and near death .





They put her on a ventilator . She had irreversible brain damage . And I went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and I hoped against hope that she would recover .

And at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother . They put her on a ventilator .


And you make amends and you never make that mistake again . And over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up . She had irreversible brain damage .

The unhealthy shame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside . You know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
Over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues . The unhealthy shame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .

And it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a doll . Why didn &apos;t I ask my attending ? Why did I send her home ? And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stupid mistake ?



And I went back to work . And on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again . And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .

I began to feel a bit better . Why did I go into medicine ? Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat .
It was busy , I was in a bit of a hurry . And on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again . Slowly but surely , it lifted .




Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat .
And even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat . And then it happened again . And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .


I looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink . He kept pointing here . Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat .

&quot; Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot; Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a strep throat . And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .




Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care . He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days . Now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .


Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care . I ordered a kidney X-ray . When it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons . He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis .


And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons . I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him . The other one had a lot of diarrhea .
And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
One I thought had a kidney stone . In both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
I ordered a kidney X-ray . When it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons .

One I thought had a kidney stone . The other one had a lot of diarrhea . And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
And I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B.S. Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?


Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ? How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ? If I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .




It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes . And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ? Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ? It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
Oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes . When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ? That &apos;s the system that we have .




That &apos;s the system that we have . But there are two problems with that . In this country , as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors .

And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system . It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .









Now take the same patient with chest pain , make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is laced with contempt . Given all of that , mistakes are inevitable . And my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
So if you take the system , as I was taught , and weed out all the error-prone health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left . I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time . And here &apos;s the thing .





On my show , on &quot; White Coat , Black Art , &quot; I made it a habit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; What about yours ? &quot; and I would point the microphone towards them . They want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did . &quot; And their pupils would dilate , they would recoil , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .

So if you take the system , as I was taught , and weed out all the error-prone health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .



And it starts with one physician at a time . The redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else . And their pupils would dilate , they would recoil , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .

So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean . And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .

And she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit . She shares her experience with others . So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .

I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea . And you &apos;d think he was chasing finches , but he wasn &apos;t . And because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .

And because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
And you &apos;d think he was chasing finches , but he wasn &apos;t . He was actually collecting fish . And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;

And you &apos;d think he was chasing finches , but he wasn &apos;t . A big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s . And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
This was the sailfin grouper . He was actually collecting fish . Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List .

Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it . But the point is , we still come to Galapagos . The brochures still say it is untouched .

And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot; He was actually collecting fish .
We still think it is pristine . A big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
The brochures still say it is untouched . A big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s . But the point is , we still come to Galapagos .
We still think it is pristine . A big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s . Because I was there in &apos; 71 , studying a lagoon in West Africa .
Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it . I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa . But the point is , we still come to Galapagos .

We still think it is pristine . The brochures still say it is untouched . I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
The second story , also to illustrate another concept , is called shifting waistline .






And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana . And the lagoon was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove . And the fish also were happy to be there .

They were maturing at five centimeters . And it had tilapia about 20 centimeters , a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia . When I went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
They were still kind of happy .
And the fish also were happy to be there . There were still fishes . And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana .
They were still kind of happy . And I went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea . When I went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .




Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 fishers And this boat , quite ugly , is called the Mutiara 4 .


And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish . What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
And I went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea . And what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it . And 90 percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
The bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess . They were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead . What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
Within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins . And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish . The bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess .
What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea . And 90 percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom . And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish .

The bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess . They were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead . And one time we caught a live one .
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat . This is a dead turtle . And one time we caught a live one .
This is a dead turtle . They were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead . And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fished . This is a dead turtle . The bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess .
They were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead . If you generalize this , something like this happens .
We adjust our baseline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there . If you generalize this , something like this happens . But it &apos;s not documented .

This mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fished . We transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .

But they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .


But they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss . And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally . Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .
And the difference then , they perceive as a loss . And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally . Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .

We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were . Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward . And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were . At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
At the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers . And that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
Because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
They become rarer because we fish them . So you don &apos;t lose abundant animals . You always lose rare animals .
Because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare . Over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish . They become rarer because we fish them .
So you don &apos;t lose abundant animals . They become rarer because we fish them . Because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations . Over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish . We want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .

And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different . And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented . Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different . Over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish . So you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in literate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different . And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented . For example , the anecdote that some present , as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .


That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline . Because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past . For example , the anecdote that some present , as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline . And hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play . We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
Because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past . That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline . There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .

In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government . If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from . In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
In the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .


And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens . And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it . And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .


If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers . And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand . We have online criminals .

We have online criminals . And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today . They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .

And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand . We have online criminals . We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand . We have online criminals . They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
Like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine . This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on . We actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .





This is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on . And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer . And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .


And then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar . These guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer . So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .

And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world . In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online . They &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly . This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens . It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .

So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks . The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money . Groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .

So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ? And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack . It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually , it was .

And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack . Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .

and issue rogue certificates .

Now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .

And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country . Well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers . What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?

So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens . They had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government . And within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .

For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found , which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .

If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped . Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .









And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ? Privacy is implied . This is not a question between privacy against security .


Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world . Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time . The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .

And in a few short years , LEGO bricks took place in every household . They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time . Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together . Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world . This may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .

LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination . Almost a hundred years later in 1947 , LEGO came up with this . The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
Like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time . It was called the Automatic Binding Brick .


LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination . You don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings . The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
LEGO made it accessible .




But there &apos;s a main difference : The transistor was only for experts . They &apos;re pre-engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors . Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits . Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits . A few years ago I started developing littleBits . LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function .
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets . You can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little dimmer .

So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets . Green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire . So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
You can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little dimmer . So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way . I &apos;m going to stop that .
Switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blinker . You put a blue to a green , you can make light . So beyond simple play , littleBits are actually pretty powerful .
You can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little dimmer . Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine . So to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .


Instead of having to program , to wire , to solder , littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures . You put a blue to a green , you can make light . So to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .




The idea behind littleBits is that it &apos;s a growing library . We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick . The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .




So for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material . A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; Make something . &quot; For example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an iPod responds to touch .

For example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an iPod responds to touch .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .


Here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a motion-activated confetti canon ball .



So go ahead and start inventing . You can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .





And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are . We &apos;re looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through it , rearranging it in any way we want . Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 megapixel range .
It &apos;s also very flexible architecture .
It &apos;s also very flexible architecture . What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment .


This is Seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data . We &apos;re looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through it , rearranging it in any way we want . It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment .
To prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .

This is a more realistic case , an issue of The Guardian . To prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture . And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium .

And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium .

To prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture . And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate . We &apos;ve made up a fake ad that &apos;s very high resolution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve embedded extra content .
This is a more realistic case , an issue of The Guardian .


But those are all the roads in the U.S. We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary . Of course , mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this .

If you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here . Of course , mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this . Or other models , or even technical specifications .




But those are all the roads in the U.S. And this one I really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
And so this is live on the Web . It &apos;s powered by Seadragon . This is a project called Photosynth , which marries two different technologies .
So let &apos;s pull up , now , something else. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research . A very nice collaboration . This is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .


You can see that when we do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience . The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken . So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially . But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .

This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr . And so these are all Flickr images , and they &apos;ve all been related spatially in this way . I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs , quite a large number of them , stitched together in this environment .

And so these are all Flickr images , and they &apos;ve all been related spatially in this way . It &apos;s very gratifying to have this kind of reception here . You just type Notre Dame into Flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts , and of the campus and so on .



What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at Microsoft . This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly .



If I can find some of the sort of weird ones -- So many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .

If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way . This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory , visually , of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together . Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered .
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory , visually , of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together . And of course , a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory . Those photos become linked , and they make something emergent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .



Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered .
Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler &apos;s Virtual Earth work .


It &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
BAA : Yes . What this is really doing is discovering , creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images . If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way . Chris Anderson : Do I understand this right ? What your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together ?
The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge .


And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have . Like when you do a web search for images , you type in phrases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of . It &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .

The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge . And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have .

&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said . &quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted . I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .


When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house . There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him . &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A real school .

&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .


You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school . &quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said . A real school .

Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .

We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping . The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .

We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping . Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going . We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .



We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents . Were we being followed ?



My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time . A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father . There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .

A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .







But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .



Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them . He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul . So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school . He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .



When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me . That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school . Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .


The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .




It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .

To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .

To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that . In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men . Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .


But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change . To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that . I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .



So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... I thought , age 21 , that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa . From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not - -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .

And we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture . And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

And we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture . Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ripples from the Zambezi , &quot; was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Zambians , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot; But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot; So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ...
And we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture . We had these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy , a tomato would grow to this size . In Zambia , to this size . And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years . I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia . And we said to the Zambians , &quot; My God , the hippos ! &quot;
Just go and read her book .

We Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either patronize them , or we are paternalistic . Because , you see , at least we fed the hippos . You should see the rubbish - -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people .


We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years . You want to read the book , read &quot; Dead Aid , &quot; by Dambisa Moyo , Zambian woman economist . Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .

The two words come from the Latin root &quot; pater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot; That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; bwana , &quot; boss .



The first principle of aid is respect . This should be the first principle of aid . I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .

This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? &quot; We have zero infrastructure . And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .

The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing . The most important thing is passion . If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing . If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ? The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .




The smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings . There is a problem with community meetings .
There is a problem with community meetings . The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available . What we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living . I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do . You have to create a new profession .
And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Maori ? Can you help us ? &quot; There is a problem with community meetings . The smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .

How can you do - ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult . Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot; We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .

Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot; There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude . Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .


Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship . So now you &apos;re rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .

Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ? There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude . You have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .




Local , passionate people . That &apos;s who you have applauded . So what I &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at . We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ? You have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves . You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .








The technologies do not exist to do that . Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with . Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Universities ? Forget about it !



There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860 .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with . It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now . And in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with . The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .

And in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years . Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them . So 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York .



First , you have to offer them confidentiality . The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management . We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .




Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them . Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;

The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management . We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .


Nobody started a company alone . No one .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : None were started by one person . We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .

We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people . So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ? What can you do ? Can you make it ?


But as these conversations unfolded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world . Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students . That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .

Really scared . Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
And I was scared . Five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland .

We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world . But these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland . I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
But these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland . So scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us . Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions .

Tell us why your science is relevant to us . I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging . You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .

And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down . Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
A few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content . Sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ? Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down . Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .

And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .



Take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding . A few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content . And the trick here is to use a single , readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .



A slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed . Instead , this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective . It &apos;s showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower . And the trick here is to use a single , readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .

Thank you .

With a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria . With a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt . And with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to SoundCloud and become famous .

This is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change . And with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to SoundCloud and become famous . That &apos;s a lot . Almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
This is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket . All this is possible with your mobile phone . But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .

This directive &#91; is &#93; called Data Retention Directive . These are 35,830 lines of information .

This directive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users . All this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider . And I will talk about this .

This directive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
We want self-determination in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us . This directive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users . And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;





They were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot; And here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said , &quot; Freedom , not fear . &quot; And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;


So I asked my phone company , Deutsche Telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me . Every time I use my mobile phone ? So I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we will not give you this information . So I asked my phone company , Deutsche Telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me . Stasi was the secret police in East Germany .
Can they really store all this information about us ? But then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are protocoling .
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany . Every time I use my mobile phone ? So I asked my phone company , Deutsche Telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
And I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . It was only blah blah answers . But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we will not give you this information . So I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information .



So I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information . But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .

And on the C.D. , this was on .


Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information . Because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional . I &apos;ll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .




At first I saw it , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a huge file . Okay . But then after a while I realized , this is my life . So I was a little bit skeptical , what should I do with it ?
This is six months of my life , into this file . So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did this . Because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .



And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne , and how often I call in between . Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean . This is a visualization of six months of my life .

First , it &apos;s only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .




And after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network . All this is possible with this information .

And then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other . First , it &apos;s only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .






If you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
Because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline . Like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket . If you have access to this information , you can control your society .


Like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket . But you have to fight for your self-determination today . And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest , and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
They want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time . And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
Because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline . When you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it . So , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not outdated .



When you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it .
They want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time . And if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .

So , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not outdated . So , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age .



I live in South Central . So the city planners , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city . Just like 26.5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Central Los Angeles , home of the drive-thru and the drive-by .


This is South Central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots . This is South Los Angeles .

People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles . For instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , Beverly Hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .


So I figured that the problem is the solution . And I figured , this has to stop .



I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars . I got tired of seeing this happening . And I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?









But you have to maintain it . So I &apos;m like , &quot; Cool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I gotta maintain it . &quot; Thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .



The city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant . So I &apos;m like , &quot; Cool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I gotta maintain it . &quot; And this is how I decided to maintain it .

A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot; What we do , we &apos;re a pay-it-forward kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunteer , and everything we do is free . The city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .

Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .

And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ? And I was like , &quot; Cool . Bring it . &quot; Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .




When one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce . That &apos;s 20 Central Parks . L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns .

They own 26 square miles of vacant lots .

Growing your own food is like printing your own money . That &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants . When one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .


And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and I &apos;m manufacturing my own reality . That &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants . See , I have a legacy in South Central .
When one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce . Why in the hell would they not okay this ? It &apos;s my gospel , when I &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .


See , I have a legacy in South Central . Gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art . You &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
Growing your own food is like printing your own money . Just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , I beautiful lawns , parkways .
Gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art .








So I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this . I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so ashamed . It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; Fin , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to steal your food ? &quot;

So I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this . It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; Fin , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to steal your food ? &quot;
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so ashamed .

That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .





There &apos;s another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles . So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
We &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate , and it &apos;s all volunteers . There &apos;s another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles . If kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
If kids grow kale , kids eat kale . But when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them . I see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- I see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes . So with gardening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .

So with gardening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life . We might produce the next George Washington Carver . And when we do this , who knows ?

but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this . We might produce the next George Washington Carver . Now this is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block . What I &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer &apos;s markets . The funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .

The funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it . I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes . So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades , gangstas , gangsta gardeners .


We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is . And let that be your weapon of choice .





If you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit . Peace . Thank you . Thank you .




One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is &quot; snollygoster . &quot; But it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language . And what snollygoster means is &quot; a dishonest politician . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t until , for example , 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber .


It wasn &apos;t until , for example , 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber . And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase &quot; as bold as brass . &quot;
And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won . And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby , who took on Parliament . Most people think that &apos;s down to the metal .

And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won . But it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language . Although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , &quot; A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy . &quot;
And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby , who took on Parliament .

I mean , some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington , and other people , His Highness George Washington , and other people , Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington . And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader . But to really show you how words and politics interact , I want to take you back to the United States of America , just after they &apos;d achieved independence .

Not that catchy . What do you call the leader of a republican country ?

And , you know , it could have worked . Some people just wanted to call him King . And everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .

Not that catchy . And they weren &apos;t even being monarchical there , they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term . And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate .

They thought it was tried and tested . And they weren &apos;t even being monarchical there , they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term .
And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate .




They didn &apos;t want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas . And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate . The House of Representatives didn &apos;t want Washington to get drunk on power .







They said , that &apos;s ridiculous , you can &apos;t call him President . And who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a silly little title like President of the United States of America ? Instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations , whether under republican or monarchical forms of government , whose custom it is to annex , through the office of the Chief Magistrate , titles of respectability -- not bloody President -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations , the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity , i.e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weirdos .
There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .



Now you can learn three interesting things from this .

But the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ? First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President .
Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 223 years later .







Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
They got their title of respectability .



And so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , redneck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politicized artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years . And this was my first time in Afghanistan . But this is the geography of self .







I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich . Now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rainbows ; I want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in . I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; Payback &quot; and impersonate a police officer , set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf .

The war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests . And where else can the jihadi gangster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; Vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot; I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich .


But I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mandates it .

Hi . My name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .

These heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them . This is the first outfit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think . If some of the women were really horrified when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
If some of the women were really horrified when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter . Not everybody gets to do that . The worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .



Well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .



Well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture . I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair . These heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .

So today , for me , being fearless means being honest . And of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
Image is powerful , but also image is superficial .


Image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
And I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .


So today , for me , being fearless means being honest . And I am on this stage because I am a model . I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy . I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl . And I am on this stage because I am a model .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and femininity and white skin . But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white .



You know ? You can be anything . But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white . And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashionistas who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . &quot;
And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashionistas who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . &quot; Well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and femininity and white skin . You could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;

But the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ? If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot; The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
And the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot; And first , I commend you on your model knowledge . Very impressive .

It &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path . If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;

You could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot; If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;

So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice HMI , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times . If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot; You could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;

Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up . If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;


Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a résumé and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your résumé reads , &quot; Underwear Model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look . This picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bikini , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet . The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they retouch all the photos ? &quot;
And yeah , they pretty much retouch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening . I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike cardio-thoracic surgeons , it can just be distilled right into -- right now . Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a résumé and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your résumé reads , &quot; Underwear Model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .

That was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .



Here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .

Here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot . Here &apos;s me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue . Here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .


I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about . And I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .





but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot; I live in New York , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked , 86 percent of them were black and Latino , and most of them were young men . When I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sorry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .

but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot; And I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot; We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
And I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are . When I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17. but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot;
So the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot; And if you ever are wondering , &quot; If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair , will I be happier ? &quot; We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
And I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot; And I &apos;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .

And I &apos;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet . When I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
And those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insecure . &quot; you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .

If there &apos;s a takeaway to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
Thank you . If there &apos;s a takeaway to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures . But I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
If there &apos;s a takeaway to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .




Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice . I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi . They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .

They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions . For four decades Gaddafi &apos;s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society . I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi .

They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi . Eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .

For four decades Gaddafi &apos;s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society . After a period of 33 years in exile , I went back to Libya , and with unique enthusiasm , I started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills . With an amazing group of women , I co-founded the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .


I led an initiative by the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list . Aware of the devastation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .

One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs . On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate . On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
Intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the &#91; aftermath &#93; of the revolution .
Our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held . We did not prioritize right .
I &apos;m rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
I &apos;m rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision . Our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held . Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?

For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .


Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced polarization and division .
We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion . Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine . Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?


Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced polarization and division . Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine . Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?

Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine . Maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion . For peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .


According to a Quranic verse &quot; Salam &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the all-merciful God , raheem . &quot; And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically . We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion . These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace . Thus we are told that &quot; My mercy encompasses all things . &quot;



In turn , the word &quot; raheem , &quot; which is known in all Abrahamic traditions , has the same root in Arabic as the word &quot; rahem &quot; -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from . And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo , which grows within it , the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence .

My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger . When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To Envy . &quot; In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .


My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger . We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot; This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering . But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister . It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .

Soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t erase from my memory . This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering . I was so shocked .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t . Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .



A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s . Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home . This is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .


I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives . Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river . In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .

I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .


In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family . But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time . I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .



I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants . Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions . In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot; So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .

Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions . One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation . So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .





These North Koreans were not so lucky . Every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed . Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated .

Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again . I even went through an identity crisis . English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language . Am I South Korean or North Korean ? That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division . Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected . Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .


Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .

Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
One time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer . It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border . The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .

It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border . The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom . Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia . They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
As the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning . Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia . Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .

I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore . We made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos . But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
I lost all hope . We made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos .

&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said . &quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot; The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said . I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot; In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .

Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .

So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more . The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support . Eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .

Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality ,

And of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .

All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .


We go through initiation rites .
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere , and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness . And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the ethnosphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate . No biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
Now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .


And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .

It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
A language is a flash of the human spirit .

They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead . And the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss . When each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .


It &apos;s a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world . And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yoruba . Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .

Let &apos;s make it Cantonese .
Now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules . And of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children . Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .




What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ? And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue . They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; linguistic exogamy : &quot; you must marry someone who speaks a different language .

And yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .

And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere , a brief journey through the ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost . Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes . Or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 . Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
Now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend . They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives . Take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
And this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .

They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .

They speared each other . 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other . They picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .

There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
But , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead . In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .

We traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway . But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing . In the early &apos; 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier &apos;s strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies . There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . Well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god . In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . And Voodoo is not a black magic cult .





Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .

So you see these astonishing demonstrations : Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .

Now , of all the peoples that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia . And for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
And at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . And the priest steps back The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .

and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you . Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the &quot; noble savage , &quot; which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are . Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .

Well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia . It means that a young kid from the Andes who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .

Whether it &apos;s the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .

Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here . This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire . It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .

It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April . What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .

Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . Take this plant here .

To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . It doesn &apos;t create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality . This is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman &apos;s repertoire .

They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .

In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucination . But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they &apos;re denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase . If you &apos;ve ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .








This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .

It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .


Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .

Wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it &apos;s the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago ,

It &apos;s not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere . It is power , the crude face of domination .




I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution . One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor . Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a crude face of political domination .
That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion . His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy . The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .

His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal . Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities . This young man &apos;s father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .

He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .




Now , that shallow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia . And it &apos;s within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . And there are great moments of optimism . The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .

And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?

So , this man &apos;s grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing . He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade . The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .

The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools . This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather . He simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . And as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .

Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world . Now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it . This old man &apos;s grandfather refused to go .
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .

It &apos;s our new homeland . It &apos;s called Nunavut .




And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all . And what we &apos;re doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world

Remi knows what love is . He &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot . When he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Remi knows what love is . He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless . He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .




He has the most impeccable memory . He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie . Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
He has the most impeccable memory . When he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be . Samuel is 16 . He &apos;s tall . He &apos;s very handsome .
When he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be . He doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies , and Lady Gaga &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary . And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure . And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I cannot recall a day without it .
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I cannot recall a day without it . Now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills . And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .

And in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .



He didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever . Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied . And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .



I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life . Remi lived and reigned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between . Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .



Because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! Everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
It just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal . But I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality . Because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! Everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal . The chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else . But I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality .

And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal . You can be extraordinary .



But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .


Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple , and exposure just a millionth of a second .
I present you a new type of photography , femto-photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion . And with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera . Now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion . Now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on . But , Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research .
But , Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research .


Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions . Some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .

Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions . So , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside . A day , a week ? Actually , a whole year .
As you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
It &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion . You can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back . As you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .

Now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?

But if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . It doesn &apos;t become dark . Meanwhile , the ripples are traveling on the table , and because of the reflections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the reflections are focused .

But if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . It doesn &apos;t become dark . You can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .

So , in the future , when this femto-camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it .


So , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you . So , in the future , when this femto-camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it . Why is that ? Because the tomato is actually ripe , and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trillionths of a second .


So , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you . And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
So , Superman can fly . It &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light . And it &apos;s not science fiction . We have actually built it .

We &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the packet of the photons , they will scatter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin , which in turn will again scatter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot . It &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light . The idea is that we could shine some light on the door .

By shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ? And because we have a camera that can run so fast , our femto-camera , it has some unique abilities .
There &apos;s a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door . And this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .

And this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance . So this is our reconstruction .

The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion . It turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .



Now , like Doc Edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra-fast photography , and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding , and we look at those ripples . Remember , the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second . So whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visualizations , since our invention , we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging . The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion .




So over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
We don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces . And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ? How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?

And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America . And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ? And these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?

And these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?



How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ? And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now . I feel like every time someone sneezes , New Orleans has a parade .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day , and forget what really matters to you . And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .










&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot; &quot; Before I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;













Thinking about death clarifies your life .




Now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it . So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .

So , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants . No one knows what the hell we do . So , dancing is one of the most human of activities .

No one knows what the hell we do .
However , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late . So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do . Now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
But frustratingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test . You have to go to the clinic to do it . It &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . It &apos;s never done .

We need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure . But frustratingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test . Now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?

So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling .

No expensive staff time required .
So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor . From the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs . Now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FoxP2 , for example .
Takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .

So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds . So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .

So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor . So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .

And they &apos;re both accurate . Okay , but in addition , voice-based tests are non-expert . You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .

You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .

So these voice-based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? We &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-invasive . The neurologist &apos;s test is non-invasive . They both use existing infrastructure . So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .



We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time . You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
When something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time . So , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative . So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .

We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time . So , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative . We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .



Anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours . We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time . We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours . With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals . So Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Yeah . Yeah . So what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . Right .

Actually , my student Thanasis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy . But we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Ninety-nine . Well , that &apos;s an improvement . Actually , my student Thanasis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy . So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
So what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .

Thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .


Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .










So I had to find a way of solving this problem . It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem . So I grew up hating lions so much .


So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire . So he jumps in and kills the animals .


And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .


They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics . And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .




Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off . And the indicator box makes the lights flash . So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .

The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed . So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed . As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from . And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .


Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working . So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions . She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .



She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her . Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working . I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .



I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .

Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .



My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . Electric fence ? But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine . You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .




My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . Electric fence ? You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ? My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . Electric fence ? We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .





Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them . My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . We &apos;re on the corner of 57th and 5th . We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .





So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture . You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger . Approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;



They &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .



This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .






So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot; I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos . And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .





When I was in my 20s , I saw my very first psychotherapy client .
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems . With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session , it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road . This I thought I could handle .
When I was in my 20s , I saw my very first psychotherapy client . Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems . &quot; Thirty &apos;s the new 20 , &quot; Alex would say , and as far as I could tell , she was right .
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client .






I pushed back . I said , &quot; Sure , she &apos;s dating down , she &apos;s sleeping with a knucklehead , but it &apos;s not like she &apos;s going to marry the guy . &quot; &quot; Thirty &apos;s the new 20 , &quot; Alex would say , and as far as I could tell , she was right .
But before long , my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life . I said , &quot; Sure , she &apos;s dating down , she &apos;s sleeping with a knucklehead , but it &apos;s not like she &apos;s going to marry the guy . &quot; And then my supervisor said , &quot; Not yet , but she might marry the next one .
And then my supervisor said , &quot; Not yet , but she might marry the next one . Besides , the best time to work on Alex &apos;s marriage is before she has one . &quot; Yes , people settle down later than they used to , but that didn &apos;t make Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental downtime .

Besides , the best time to work on Alex &apos;s marriage is before she has one . &quot;
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time .


That made Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental sweet spot , and we were sitting there blowing it . We &apos;re talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one &apos;s getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first . Raise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20s .
Yes , people settle down later than they used to , but that didn &apos;t make Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental downtime . That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere .




Raise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20s .
I really want to see some twentysomethings here . There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now . Raise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20s .



We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you &apos;re going to earn . We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 . This crowd is going to be fine , I think .

We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood , which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself , now is the time to change it . We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life , and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28 , and things get tricky after age 35 . This crowd is going to be fine , I think .
People who are over 40 , don &apos;t panic .

We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life , and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28 , and things get tricky after age 35 . We know that 80 percent of life &apos;s most defining moments take place by age 35 . We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood , which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself , now is the time to change it .

Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like &quot; twixters &quot; and &quot; kidults . &quot; But this isn &apos;t what twentysomethings are hearing . Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood .
So when we think about child development , we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain . But what we hear less about is that there &apos;s such a thing as adult development , and our 20s are that critical period of adult development . Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood .


It &apos;s true . Isn &apos;t that true ? So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say , &quot; You have 10 extra years to start your life &quot; ?



Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time . Or they say , &quot; Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I &apos;m 30 , I &apos;ll be fine . &quot; It &apos;s true .
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition , and absolutely nothing happens . Nothing happens .
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition , and absolutely nothing happens . But then it starts to sound like this : &quot; My 20s are almost over , and I have nothing to show for myself . And then every day , smart , interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this : &quot; I know my boyfriend &apos;s no good for me , but this relationship doesn &apos;t count . I &apos;m just killing time . &quot;

Everybody was running around and having fun , but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down . And then it starts to sound like this : &quot; Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs . But then it starts to sound like this : &quot; My 20s are almost over , and I have nothing to show for myself .




I didn &apos;t want to be the only one left standing up , so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30 . &quot;
But then it starts to sound like this : &quot; My 20s are almost over , and I have nothing to show for myself .
Many of these things are incompatible , and as research is just starting to show , simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s . When a lot has been pushed to your 30s , there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career , pick a city , partner up , and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time . Do not do that .

It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that child you now want , or you can &apos;t give your child a sibling . It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that career you now want .
It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that child you now want , or you can &apos;t give your child a sibling . The post-millennial midlife crisis isn &apos;t buying a red sports car . When a lot has been pushed to your 30s , there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career , pick a city , partner up , and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time .

She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided yet , so she &apos;d spent the last few years waiting tables instead . She often cried in our sessions , but then would collect herself by saying , &quot; You can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends . &quot; And as hard as her 20s were , her early life had been even harder .










First , I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital . Emma needed a better life , and I knew this was her chance . But what Emma needed wasn &apos;t some therapist who really , really cared .
So over the next weeks and months , I told Emma three things that every twentysomething , male or female , deserves to hear .



Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know , what they know , how they think , how they speak , and where they work . I &apos;m not discounting twentysomething exploration here , but I am discounting exploration that &apos;s not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration .
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know , what they know , how they think , how they speak , and where they work . I told Emma to explore work and make it count . That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .

I didn &apos;t know the future of Emma &apos;s career , and no one knows the future of work , but I do know this : Identity capital begets identity capital . I &apos;m not discounting twentysomething exploration here , but I am discounting exploration that &apos;s not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration .
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know , what they know , how they think , how they speak , and where they work . So yes , half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed . I &apos;m not discounting twentysomething exploration here , but I am discounting exploration that &apos;s not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration .


But half aren &apos;t , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group . That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .

New things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends .
It &apos;s not cheating . It &apos;s the science of how information spreads . Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and I agree with you . That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
But grabbing whoever you &apos;re living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress . Half of new jobs are never posted , so reaching out to your neighbor &apos;s boss is how you get that un-posted job . Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and I agree with you .
Now this was true for her growing up , but as a twentysomething , soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own . New things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends .
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now . Last but not least , Emma believed that you can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends . Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you .

She &apos;s married to a man she mindfully chose .

She loves her new career , she loves her new family , and she sent me a card that said , &quot; Now the emergency contact blanks don &apos;t seem big enough . &quot; Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX , bound for somewhere west . Well , we went through that address book , and she found an old roommate &apos;s cousin who worked at an art museum in another state .
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend . So what happened to Emma ?


Now Emma &apos;s story made that sound easy , but that &apos;s what I love about working with twentysomethings . Right after takeoff , a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji . Likewise , at 21 or 25 or even 29 , one good conversation , one good break , one good TED Talk , can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come .







It &apos;s what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day : Thirty is not the new 20 , so claim your adulthood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family .

And this gap has become shorter , shorter , and even shorter , and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter , the thickness of a touch-screen glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone . First , I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it transfers its physical body into pixels .



Throughout the history of computers we &apos;ve been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild . How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ? At Microsoft Applied Sciences , along with my mentor Cati Boulanger , I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace .

By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face , now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pixels with your bare hands . First , I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it transfers its physical body into pixels . But our two hands still remain outside the screen .

By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face , now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pixels with your bare hands . Because windows and files have a position in the real space , selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf .
So in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ? At Microsoft Applied Sciences , along with my mentor Cati Boulanger , I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace .
So in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world . Taking this idea further , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?

I &apos;m sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .

At MIT Media Lab , along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post , we created this one physical pixel .
But now you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
Taking this idea further , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ? Well , in this case , this spherical magnet acts like a 3D pixel in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space . And by digitally programming the object , we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space , which means that now , human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world .


And what &apos;s more exciting than just turning what &apos;s currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities . As you can see , the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world .

But my tiger mother said , &quot; No . &quot;
But my tiger mother said , &quot; No . &quot;


My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them . It is not important if I like the job or not .

But my tiger mother said , &quot; No . &quot; After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was . No adults believed I was serious . But no adults liked the idea .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school . No adults believed I was serious . Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .

I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show . An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .

An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school . Nobody around to teach me ? Fine . But no adults liked the idea .
But that &apos;s so unfair . Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was . So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .

So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained . Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was . My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for . So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained . Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these . I turned to books . So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .




Books banned in China , of course . &#91; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?

&#91; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?

&quot; Honor , &quot; I said . &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot;
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot; The Bible is interesting , but strange .

Comparative reading actually is nothing new . The Bible is interesting , but strange . But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;

It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world . Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading . So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .

Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ? Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading . There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic . So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ? Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ? So they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; John Adams &quot; by David McCullough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences . &#91; &quot; Personal History &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres -- &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; Lamb &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; -- or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .

For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty -- interesting . &#91; &quot; Personal History &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres -- &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; Lamb &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; -- or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual . For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; happiness &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; fast joy . &quot; Huh ! So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
So they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; John Adams &quot; by David McCullough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences . So I started reading books in pairs .




So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
Even a shattered dream can do that for you . So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time . Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .


Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered . So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time . I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .





She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case , super strong on state capitals , just a great speller .
I fiddled with my rival &apos;s grades , just a little , just demoted some of those A &apos;s .


So one day I stayed a little late after school , a little too late , and I lurked in the girls &apos; bathroom .

I gave everybody a row of D &apos;s and I gave myself a row of A &apos;s , just because I was there , you know , might as well . She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case , super strong on state capitals , just a great speller .

All of those A &apos;s .
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer , when hang on , some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too . I fiddled with my rival &apos;s grades , just a little , just demoted some of those A &apos;s .


I don &apos;t understand why I felt so great doing it . I don &apos;t understand why I was never caught . And I am still baffled by my behavior .

I don &apos;t understand why I felt so great doing it . I gave everybody a row of D &apos;s and I gave myself a row of A &apos;s , just because I was there , you know , might as well .


I don &apos;t understand why I was never caught . I mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .


We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States . We know primates do . Bluebirds are actually very prone . Jealousy baffles me .




We know babies suffer from jealousy . And yet , I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill . We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States .


No jealousy , no Proust . And now , I mean , I know it &apos;s fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything , but in the case of jealousy , he kind of does . We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States . Well no faithless Helen , no &quot; Odyssey . &quot;




I mean , these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut . We forget how pitiless he is . There goes high school reading lists , because we &apos;re losing &quot; Sound and the Fury , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; Gatsby , &quot; &quot; Sun Also Rises , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; Madame Bovary , &quot; &quot; Anna K. &quot;
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea . And we think about Proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ? We forget how harsh his vision was .
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep . And we think about Proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ?
We forget how pitiless he is . I mean , these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut . And we think about Proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ?
We forget how harsh his vision was .

I mean , these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut . Is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ? Let &apos;s look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and Proust .

Let &apos;s look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and Proust . As the teller of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to dig that knife in . Right ? I mean , these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut .
When we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story . Is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ? Let &apos;s look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and Proust .
I don &apos;t know . I think it cuts very close to the bone , because let &apos;s think about what happens when we feel jealous . Is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists , and this is something Proust understood .





In the first volume , Swann &apos;s Way , the series of books , Swann , one of the main characters , is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sentences , and these are Proustian sentences , so they &apos;re long as rivers , but in the course of a few sentences , he suddenly recoils and he realizes , &quot; Hang on , everything I love about this woman , somebody else would love about this woman .
But you don &apos;t have to be that jealous to concede that it &apos;s hard work . Right ? And what does jealousy like ? You know , Proust &apos;s boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him .

Jealousy is exhausting . And what does jealousy like ? Jealousy likes information .



Jealousy likes details . Jealousy likes photos . Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case .
Jealousy likes photos . Jealousy likes information . Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case .
Jealousy likes information . Jealousy likes details . Jealousy likes photos .
Jealousy likes information . Jealousy likes details . Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case .

Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where Proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better . Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case . Jealousy likes information .
He says , &quot; They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . &quot; Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy . Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where Proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better .
That &apos;s why Instagram is such a hit . Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
He says , &quot; You know , look , I know you think this is repugnant , but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument . &quot; Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where Proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better . Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy .
He says , &quot; You know , look , I know you think this is repugnant , but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument . &quot;

Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ?
No . I think he &apos;s trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves . Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where Proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better . He says , &quot; A woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . &quot;
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ? And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?

Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ? Because she &apos;s blameless ; everybody knows it . He says , &quot; A woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . &quot;
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ? And Freud says , it &apos;s something strange about this guy , because he &apos;s not looking at what his wife is doing . The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause .


&#91; Freud &#93; says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife &apos;s unconscious .

And Freud says , it &apos;s something strange about this guy , because he &apos;s not looking at what his wife is doing . But he &apos;s looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing , unintentional behaviors .
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .

And Freud says , it &apos;s something strange about this guy , because he &apos;s not looking at what his wife is doing . In fact , the more intensely jealous we are , the more we become residents of fantasy . But he &apos;s looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing , unintentional behaviors .

Is she smiling too brightly here , or did she accidentally brush up against a man there ?
And this is why , I think , jealousy doesn &apos;t just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things . Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive . The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .

And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend &apos;s new girlfriend , and I have to confess when I heard this , I just reacted with admiration . Because , I mean , let &apos;s be real . Now I &apos;m thinking of myself at eight , I concede , but I &apos;m also thinking of this story I heard on the news .


That &apos;s one way to go .
She &apos;s the author of &quot; Strangers on a Train &quot; and &quot; The Talented Mr. Ripley , &quot; books that are all about how jealousy , it muddles our minds , and once we &apos;re in the sphere , in that realm of jealousy , the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant . But what do we do ? We can &apos;t go the Tom Ripley route . This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel .

Now , Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had , and you &apos;re under the floorboards , he &apos;s answering to your name , he &apos;s wearing your rings , emptying your bank account . She &apos;s the author of &quot; Strangers on a Train &quot; and &quot; The Talented Mr. Ripley , &quot; books that are all about how jealousy , it muddles our minds , and once we &apos;re in the sphere , in that realm of jealousy , the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant . But what do we do ? We can &apos;t go the Tom Ripley route .





And it &apos;s a pity , because we live in envious times . I mean , we &apos;re all good citizens of social media , aren &apos;t we , where the currency is envy ? Now , Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had , and you &apos;re under the floorboards , he &apos;s answering to your name , he &apos;s wearing your rings , emptying your bank account .


So Lestrade needs his help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries .


So Lestrade needs his help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries .
When people think of Holmes , they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind . It &apos;s one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries , and I find it very moving , this little scene , but it &apos;s also mysterious , right ? So let &apos;s do what characters always do when they &apos;re not sure , when they are in possession of a mystery .
But I &apos;ve always preferred &#91; Inspector &#93; Lestrade , who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately , needs Holmes &apos; genius , but resents him . But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in &quot; The Adventure of the Six Napoleons , &quot; once Holmes comes in , dazzles everybody with his solution , Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says , &quot; We &apos;re not jealous of you , Mr. Holmes .
It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion . But I &apos;ve always preferred &#91; Inspector &#93; Lestrade , who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately , needs Holmes &apos; genius , but resents him . When people think of Holmes , they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind .



And he says that there &apos;s not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn &apos;t want to shake Sherlock Holmes &apos; hand . Could it be so simple though ? It &apos;s one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries , and I find it very moving , this little scene , but it &apos;s also mysterious , right ?

And he says that there &apos;s not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn &apos;t want to shake Sherlock Holmes &apos; hand . It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion . What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ?

You know , one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade .

What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ? Suddenly , Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he &apos;s resented . Fiction alone demystifies jealousy .
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ? Fiction alone domesticates it , invites it to the table . Well , maybe then we wouldn &apos;t have to resent somebody &apos;s excellence .
Well , maybe then we wouldn &apos;t have to resent somebody &apos;s excellence . Fiction alone demystifies jealousy . Suddenly , Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he &apos;s resented .

Fiction alone domesticates it , invites it to the table . We are in excellent company . But I like contingency plans .
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy . And look who it gathers : sweet Lestrade , terrifying Tom Ripley , crazy Swann , Marcel Proust himself . We could align ourselves with it .

The official dogma of what ? And the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom . The official dogma of all Western industrial societies .

And the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom . The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .


And the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom .

The more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have . 175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you . And because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .


And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , CD player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .

We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , CD player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems . So this is what the supermarket is like .



We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones . One consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke . There was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma Bell .
My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch . We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store . You rented your phone . You didn &apos;t buy it .





So , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .


So , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true . My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and crème brûlée torch .
And if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon , you will . And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .

Health care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do . It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much . A has these benefits , and these risks .
B has these benefits , and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot; And the doc says , &quot; A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks . Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B.
And the doc says , &quot; A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks . A has these benefits , and these risks . Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B.






Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
There &apos;s enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .


And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .



We don &apos;t inherit an identity ; we get to invent it . With respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could . It &apos;s because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , &quot; Should I get married or not ? Should I get married now ?

And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses . And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less diligent .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to . And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .

It &apos;s because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , &quot; Should I get married or not ? Should I get married now ?
It &apos;s because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , &quot; Should I get married or not ? Should I get married now ?
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to . It &apos;s because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , &quot; Should I get married or not ? Should I get married now ? Should I get married later ? Should I have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;


We can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps . And even if they &apos;re all shut off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mutilate a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; Should I answer this cell phone call ? So what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
Work -- we are blessed , as Carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel . There is one corner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi actually works . We can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps .

And even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s soccer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .



So what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working . And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ? And the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;








One effect , paradoxically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liberation .


A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard , the gigantic mutual-fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces . I &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans . Because with 50 funds to choose from , it &apos;s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered , rate of participation went down two percent . By not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .

Because with 50 funds to choose from , it &apos;s so damn hard to decide which fund to choose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
By not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or the wrong salad dressing .
And I think it makes the world look like this . &#91; And lastly , for all eternity , French , bleu cheese , or ranch ? &#93; You really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ? So that &apos;s one effect . The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from . And then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .


So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices . The more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose .


is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salad dressing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , So that &apos;s one effect . The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from . You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or the wrong salad dressing .

And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , Well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen. even if it was a good decision .

Second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot; Very expensive real estate . Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street &#93; Sorry if you &apos;re not New Yorkers .
Second , what economists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;

Well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen . &quot; Well , damn it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; It &apos;s August . Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away . The more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose .
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to . Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th street &#93; Sorry if you &apos;re not New Yorkers . Well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen .


subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific . Gorgeous beach . Beautiful day . They have it all to themselves . And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
Gorgeous beach . Beautiful day . They have it all to themselves .
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific . Gorgeous beach . Beautiful day . They have it all to themselves .
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space . And the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs .
But one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choosing one thing , you &apos;re choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attractive .



And the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs . I wear jeans almost all the time . I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a pair of jeans . Here &apos;s my size . &quot;

But one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re choosing one thing , you &apos;re choosing not to do other things that may have lots of attractive features , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attractive . There was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , they were incredibly uncomfortable , if you wore them and washed them enough times , they started to feel OK . It makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .


This hit me when I went to replace my jeans .


You want boot cut , tapered , blah blah . &quot; On and on he went . I wear jeans almost all the time . You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
You want button fly or zipper fly ? You want stonewashed or acid-washed ? And the shopkeeper said , &quot; Do you want slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ? My jaw dropped . And after I recovered , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;



The reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up . I did better . All this choice made it possible for me to do better .

But -- I felt worse .

And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
When they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect . &#91; It all looks so great . I can &apos;t wait to be disappointed . &#93; Because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about . The reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .




The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations . You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .

I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
The truth is more like this .
&#91; Everything was better back when everything was worse &#93; The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
&#91; It all looks so great . I can &apos;t wait to be disappointed . &#93; Because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .


I couldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t settle . Finally -- One consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible .


Finally -- One consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure . And so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them ; they blame themselves .

And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse . With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
I believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fault .

This is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all false . It is not true .
Now , as a policy matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence . And so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse . I &apos;m pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .






There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice . I &apos;m pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare . It &apos;s a waste of money .

What I &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help . They actually hurt . They actually make us worse off .

And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this : Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don &apos;t help . They actually hurt . It &apos;s a waste of money .

And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this : Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don &apos;t help . If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be improved , but ours would be improved also , which is what economists call a &quot; Pareto-improving move . &quot;

Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us .

Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . You have paralysis . If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
The more I thought about it , however , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something . So to conclude . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no limits &#93; You &apos;re supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , &quot; Ah ! What does this fish know ?

If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction . You know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &quot;
You increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction . Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . You have paralysis . You know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . &quot;







It was a beautiful day . The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass , and if it weren &apos;t for the path we were following , we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land .




It was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal , beautiful lake , when I discovered a horror . The forest was sparkling . That question stayed with me , and it simplified a little .

Behind the lean-to was a dump , maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil , and a dead sneaker .

Who cleans up after us ? Who cleans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London ?







So I started a research project with them . I wanted to get to know them as individuals . I rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city , and I learned a lot , but I was still an outsider .





Everyone asks about the smell .

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country , and I learned why .






According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country , and I learned why . It never stops coming .

It just wants to get past you , so it &apos;s often the motorist is not paying attention . I also learned about the relentlessness of trash . When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck , you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself .







If we can &apos;t throw out the old stuff , we have no room for the new stuff , so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised . If they &apos;re not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day , it starts to spill out of its containments , and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways . I &apos;m not advocating capitalism , I &apos;m just pointing out their relationship .


We usually don &apos;t care for , repair , clean , carry around our coffee cup , our shopping bag , our bottle of water .
By that I simply mean how fast we &apos;re used to moving in the contemporary day and age .

Their work , I think , is kind of liturgical . They wear a uniform in many cities .





They wear a uniform in many cities . So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about sanitation that will perhaps help ameliorate the stigma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane . They are almost a form of reassurance .

You know when to expect them . Their work , I think , is kind of liturgical . And he looked at me , and he just nodded , and he said , &quot; We &apos;re going to be okay .
They wear a uniform in many cities . They &apos;re on the streets every day , rhythmically . It was a little while later that I started my research with sanitation , and I met that man again .











And we also would be well informed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their expertise on how do we think about , how do we create systems around sustainability that perhaps take us from curbside recycling , which is a remarkable success across 40 years , across the United States and countries around the world , and lift us up to a broader horizon where we &apos;re looking at other forms of waste that could be lessened from manufacturing and industrial sources .




Hello , TEDWomen , what &apos;s up . My name is Maysoon Zayid , and I am not drunk , but the doctor who delivered me was . As a result , I have cerebral palsy , which means I shake all the time .


My name is Maysoon Zayid , and I am not drunk , but the doctor who delivered me was .
Not good enough . It &apos;s not a birth defect . You can &apos;t catch it . It only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day .

It &apos;s not a birth defect . You can &apos;t catch it . It only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day . No one put a curse on my mother &apos;s uterus , and I didn &apos;t get it because my parents are first cousins , which they are .


Now , I must warn you , I &apos;m not inspirational , and I don &apos;t want anyone in this room to feel bad for me , because at some point in your life , you have dreamt of being disabled . Come on a journey with me .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; God , can &apos;t I just be a little disabled ? &quot; Also , I gotta tell you , I got 99 problems , and palsy is just one . It &apos;s exhausting . I &apos;m like Shakira , Shakira meets Muhammad Ali .


It &apos;s Christmas Eve , you &apos;re at the mall , you &apos;re driving around in circles looking for parking , and what do you see ? If you don &apos;t feel better about yourself , maybe you should . If there was an Oppression Olympics , I would win the gold medal .
Now , I must warn you , I &apos;m not inspirational , and I don &apos;t want anyone in this room to feel bad for me , because at some point in your life , you have dreamt of being disabled . Sixteen empty handicapped spaces . Also , I gotta tell you , I got 99 problems , and palsy is just one .
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials . If there was an Oppression Olympics , I would win the gold medal .

And you &apos;re like , &quot; God , can &apos;t I just be a little disabled ? &quot; A lot of people with C.P. don &apos;t walk , but my parents didn &apos;t believe in &quot; can &apos;t . &quot;




My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking . I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City , I could . So , if my three older sisters were mopping , I was mopping .



I don &apos;t think anyone even noticed we weren &apos;t Italian . My inner stripper was very strong , and by -- Yeah . No , by the first day of kindergarten , I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times . I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City , I could .

My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking .

Growing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family . My inner stripper was very strong , and by -- Yeah . No , by the first day of kindergarten , I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times . If my three older sisters went to public school , my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too , and if we didn &apos;t all get A &apos;s , we all got my mother &apos;s slipper .
Growing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family . This was before 9 / 11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use &quot; I hate Moslems &quot; as a campaign slogan . I have tap-danced on Broadway .



They did , however , seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan . The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith .
I learned how to dance in heels , which means I can walk in heels .
My parents couldn &apos;t afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dancing school . I learned how to dance in heels , which means I can walk in heels . And I &apos;m from Jersey , and we are really concerned with being chic , so if my friends wore heels , so did I.

I did all the less-than-intelligent kids &apos; homework , I got A &apos;s in all of my classes , A &apos;s in all of their classes . Every time I did a scene from &quot; The Glass Menagerie , &quot; my professors would weep . But one miracle cure we did find was yoga .



But I never got cast . Everybody loved me .
Every time I did a scene from &quot; The Glass Menagerie , &quot; my professors would weep . So I start shouting from the rooftops , &quot; I &apos;m finally going to get a part ! It &apos;s a play about a girl with C.P.
I was a girl with C.P. So I start shouting from the rooftops , &quot; I &apos;m finally going to get a part !

But instead , I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head , and it became clear to me that casting directors didn &apos;t hire fluffy , ethnic , disabled actors . I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically , like someone shot my cat , to ask her why , and she said it was because they didn &apos;t think I could do the stunts .



Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen . They only hired perfect people . I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg , Roseanne Barr , Ellen , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were comedians .

And I knew that I would be promoted from &quot; diner diner &quot; to &quot; wacky best friend &quot; in no time . So I became a comic .





In 2003 , my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival , now in its 10th year . Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media , while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous . I &apos;ve performed in clubs all over America , and I &apos;ve also performed in Arabic in the Middle East , uncensored and uncovered .

My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey , and I &apos;ll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with C.P. driving him .






So I had to grip onto the anchor &apos;s desk so that I wouldn &apos;t roll off the screen during the segment , and when the interview was over , I was livid .
I walked in looking like I was going to the prom , and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning , rolling chair .
But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back , he made me a full-time contributor , and he taped down my chair . So I had to grip onto the anchor &apos;s desk so that I wouldn &apos;t roll off the screen during the segment , and when the interview was over , I was livid . So I looked at the stage manager and I &apos;m like , &quot; Excuse me , can I have another chair ? &quot;

But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back , he made me a full-time contributor , and he taped down my chair . I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it , and I knew I would never get invited back .

One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits : screenwriter , comedian , palsy . People say children are cruel , but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult . Suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .


I would look at clips online and see comments like , &quot; Yo , why &apos;s she tweakin ? &quot; And my favorite , &quot; Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist . Suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .



People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world , and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment .

Disability is as visual as race . I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life . Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well . Perhaps if there were more positive images , it would foster less hate on the Internet . Disability is as visual as race .



Or maybe not .





My name is Maysoon Zayid , and if I can can , you can can .
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live , and I dedicate this talk to his memory . I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol , the amazing Dave Matthews . I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild .
But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- - but the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee , has Parkinson &apos;s and shakes just like me , Muhammad Ali .

On July 21st , 1969 , Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11 &apos;s lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility .

Twelve walked on its surface , of whom Aldrin , following the death of Armstrong last year , is now the most senior . The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States . Armstrong and Aldrin were alone , but their presence on the moon &apos;s gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive , collective effort .
To get to the moon , NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today &apos;s money , or four percent of the federal budget . So , we used to solve big problems . Twelve walked on its surface , of whom Aldrin , following the death of Armstrong last year , is now the most senior .


But before the Apollo program ended , 24 men flew to the moon . They didn &apos;t bring much back : 841 pounds of old rocks , and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home . So why did they go ?

But before the Apollo program ended , 24 men flew to the moon . Twelve walked on its surface , of whom Aldrin , following the death of Armstrong last year , is now the most senior . To contemporaries , Apollo wasn &apos;t only a victory of West over East in the Cold War .

They didn &apos;t bring much back : 841 pounds of old rocks , and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home . But Kennedy &apos;s own words at Rice University in 1962 provide a better clue .
Why did they go ? The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets .






No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10 , and blithe optimism about technology &apos;s powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve , such as going to Mars , creating clean energy , curing cancer , or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard . At the time , the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology .

For most of human history , we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail , but in 1969 , the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour . No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10 , and blithe optimism about technology &apos;s powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve , such as going to Mars , creating clean energy , curing cancer , or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard . I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17 .
So &quot; Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology &quot; has become a commonplace .

Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems . We &apos;ve heard it over the last two days here at TED . But I don &apos;t think that explanation is good enough .
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame , in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs . Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems . It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys , with things like iPhones and apps and social media , or algorithms that speed automated trading .
Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems . So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley , which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel , Microsoft , Apple and Genentech .

Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems . V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy , and V.C.s have never , never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value .

No , the reasons we can &apos;t solve big problems are more complicated and more profound . Today , less than two percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption derives from advanced , renewable sources such as solar , wind and biofuels , less than two percent , and the reason is purely economic .

Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems . But there &apos;s no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus . But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .



We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price . None exist .

Finally , big problems sometimes elude solution because we don &apos;t really understand the problem . Today , less than two percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption derives from advanced , renewable sources such as solar , wind and biofuels , less than two percent , and the reason is purely economic . Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food , but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments .
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution . Now , technologists , business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy : mostly , a significant increase in energy research and development , and some kind of price on carbon . President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971 , but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer , most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy , and it is only in the last 10 years that effective , viable therapies have come to seem real .


It &apos;s not true that we can &apos;t solve big problems through technology . The Apollo mission , which has become a kind of metaphor for technology &apos;s capacity to solve big problems , met these criteria . Sometimes , big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so .

We can , we must , but these four elements must all be present : Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem ; institutions must support its solution ; It must really be a technological problem ; and we must understand it .

Thank you very much . Most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy . There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War , no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous , and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system .

This is a guy called Ed Cook who had come over from England where he had one of the best trained memories . And I said to him , &quot; Ed , when did you realize that you were a savant ? &quot; They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes .

I was like , this is unbelievable . They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers . They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest .
We &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece , the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches , that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books . &quot; Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory . In fact , I have just an average memory .

&quot; Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television . I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory , but also investigating it , trying to understand how it works , why it sometimes doesn &apos;t work and what its potential might be . Do you know Britney Spears ? &quot;

He &apos;s an amnesic who had , very possibly , the very worst memory in the world .

I met a host of really interesting people . And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff . This is a guy called E.P.




One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time , this idea of having a trained , disciplined , cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today . And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises , treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin in Antiquity and then later in the Middle Ages . They &apos;ve changed us culturally , and I would argue that they &apos;ve changed us cognitively .

One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time , this idea of having a trained , disciplined , cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today . One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained , disciplined , cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest . Once upon a time , people invested in their memories , in laboriously furnishing their minds .
It &apos;s actually not that singular , there are contests held all over the world .

Of note , they were using , or they seemed to be using , a part of the brain that &apos;s involved in spatial memory and navigation . There was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to . When they put these guys in an fMRI machine , scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people &apos;s faces and pictures of snowflakes , they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else .




And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions , everything , all of the techniques that are being used , ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding .




The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly , and then the rest of the field has to play catchup . He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour . On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour , using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered .
The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker . And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions , everything , all of the techniques that are being used , ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding . And I come back to you at some point later on , and I say , &quot; Do you remember that word that I told you a while back ?




And it &apos;s well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker / baker paradox , which goes like this : If I tell two people to remember the same word , if I say to you , &quot; Remember that there is a guy named Baker . &quot; Same word , different amount of remembering ; that &apos;s weird . And I come back to you at some point later on , and I say , &quot; Do you remember that word that I told you a while back ?
Well the name Baker doesn &apos;t actually mean anything to you . What &apos;s going on here ? But the common noun baker , we know bakers .



Maybe we even know a baker . The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is that he is a baker .



One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece . And when we first hear that word , we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date .
But the common noun baker , we know bakers .

And he stands up , delivers his poem from memory , walks out the door , and at the moment he does , the banquet hall collapses , kills everybody inside .


And he stands up , delivers his poem from memory , walks out the door , and at the moment he does , the banquet hall collapses , kills everybody inside . The story behind its creation goes like this : There was a poet called Simonides who was attending a banquet . Nobody can say who was inside , nobody can say where they were sitting .


Simonides , standing outside , the sole survivor amid the wreckage , closes his eyes and has this realization , which is that in his mind &apos;s eye , he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting . What Simonides figured out at that moment is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know , which is that , as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues , we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories . The story behind its creation goes like this : There was a poet called Simonides who was attending a banquet .




Simonides , standing outside , the sole survivor amid the wreckage , closes his eyes and has this realization , which is that in his mind &apos;s eye , he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting . The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind &apos;s eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier , weirder , more bizarre , funnier , raunchier , stinkier the image is , the more unforgettable it &apos;s likely to be .


And you &apos;d come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy , ridiculous , unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest .

And you &apos;d come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy , ridiculous , unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest . This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches -- not word-for-word , which is just going to screw you up , but topic-for-topic . And then you &apos;d see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .


The phrase &quot; in the first place , &quot; that &apos;s like in the first place of your memory palace . In fact , the phrase &quot; topic sentence , &quot; that comes from the Greek word &quot; topos , &quot; which means &quot; place . &quot; And I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers .

And you go into your kitchen , and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year , and you have some friends to help you remember that . That &apos;s a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms . And I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers .

The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event . And I went to a few more of these memory contests .

Truly , it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs . I mean , the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples .






Maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market . What you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re trying to get better and better and better at creating , at dreaming up , these utterly ludicrous , raunchy , hilarious and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind &apos;s eye . I know that there &apos;s this incredible stuff happening in these people &apos;s minds , but I don &apos;t have access to it .

It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory . And I got pretty into it . What you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re trying to get better and better and better at creating , at dreaming up , these utterly ludicrous , raunchy , hilarious and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind &apos;s eye .

And I found that this was shockingly fun . This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer &apos;s training kit .

I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier . This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer &apos;s training kit . It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory .
It &apos;s a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes , because distraction is the competitive memorizer &apos;s greatest enemy .

And I had this notion that I might enter it , sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism . And I got pretty into it . I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier .



And you don &apos;t have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works .



We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift , but that is not the case .
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience and figure out why it is meaningful to us , why it is significant , why it &apos;s colorful , when we &apos;re able to transform it in some way that it makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds , when we &apos;re able to transform Bakers into bakers . We remember when we are deeply engaged . We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift , but that is not the case .

At the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention . We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift , but that is not the case .


The memory palace , these memory techniques , they &apos;re just shortcuts . But there actually are no shortcuts . They work because they make you work .

The memory palace , these memory techniques , they &apos;re just shortcuts . They work because they make you work . But there actually are no shortcuts .

But if you want to live a memorable life , you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember . I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us . They force a kind of depth of processing , a kind of mindfulness , that most of us don &apos;t normally walk around exercising .

And I think if there &apos;s one thing that I want to leave you with , it &apos;s what E.P. , the amnesic who couldn &apos;t even remember that he had a memory problem , left me with , which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories .
How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives by losing ourselves in our Blackberries , our iPhones , by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us , by being so lazy that we &apos;re not willing to process deeply ? But if you want to live a memorable life , you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember . But there actually are no shortcuts .
This is how stuff is made memorable .




Some of my smartest kids weren &apos;t doing so well . I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools . And like any teacher , I made quizzes and tests .



What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students . Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric I.Q. scores . And like any teacher , I made quizzes and tests .

But these concepts are not impossible , and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough .

So I left the classroom , and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist .
After several more years of teaching , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective , from a psychological perspective . The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math , sure , they &apos;re hard : ratios , decimals , the area of a parallelogram .

In education , the one thing we know how to measure best is I.Q. , but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ? We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ? We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition .


I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ? So I left the classroom , and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist .

I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ? In all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success .


In all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success . It wasn &apos;t good looks , physical health , and it wasn &apos;t I.Q. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ?
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ? And it wasn &apos;t social intelligence . We partnered with private companies , asking , which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs ?

And it wasn &apos;t social intelligence . Grit is sticking with your future , day in , day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make that future a reality . And who &apos;s going to earn the most money ?
Grit is living life like it &apos;s a marathon , not a sprint . Grit is sticking with your future , day in , day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make that future a reality . Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .


Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate , even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure , things like family income , standardized achievement test scores , even how safe kids felt when they were at school . So it &apos;s not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters . It &apos;s also in school , especially for kids at risk for dropping out . Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build grit in kids ?

The honest answer is , I don &apos;t know . Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate , even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure , things like family income , standardized achievement test scores , even how safe kids felt when they were at school .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build grit in kids ? What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic ? Grit is living life like it &apos;s a marathon , not a sprint .

Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build grit in kids ? How do I keep them motivated for the long run ? &quot;

Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build grit in kids ?
In fact , in our data , grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent . So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot; Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build grit in kids ?
In fact , in our data , grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent . What I do know is that talent doesn &apos;t make you gritty . What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?
What I do know is that talent doesn &apos;t make you gritty . So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot; What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?

Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge , they &apos;re much more likely to persevere when they fail , because they don &apos;t believe that failure is a permanent condition .
So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot; So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit .
So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot; And that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to end my remarks , because that &apos;s where we are . In fact , in our data , grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent .



We need to measure whether we &apos;ve been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned .

My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions . And this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design .
The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia &apos;s capital city Addis Ababa .
My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions . After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points . First , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things .
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design . My work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions . Both projects are in emerging countries , one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia .
The first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in Ethiopia &apos;s capital city Addis Ababa . And also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture . Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this .
First , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things . And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia . In a city where this shouldn &apos;t happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .

After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points . And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia . Second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling .

Second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling . First , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things .


So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building . And it &apos;s also between two parallel streets that don &apos;t have any connection for hundreds of meters . The next challenge was when we looked at the site , that is , in a really growing area of the city , where most of these buildings that you see in the image , they were not there .
And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain . But the question was how we could do a multistory , contemporary building with these principles .

And this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain .

So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building . But the question was how we could do a multistory , contemporary building with these principles . And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian women &apos;s dresses .
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful buttons of the Ethiopian women &apos;s dresses . And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions . And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way .
That they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade . So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building . And it &apos;s also between two parallel streets that don &apos;t have any connection for hundreds of meters .
And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .

And I started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way . And around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops , that change in each floor because of the shape of the void .

And we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .


So we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project . But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell .
And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day .

Hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction . And for doing such a big project , the biggest project I &apos;ve ever designed , I really needed to understand the city of Tunis , but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture . And these porches on the roof , all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside .
And the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day . And also that the idea of the facade was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we didn &apos;t need to have air conditioning anymore . But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell .
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof .


And the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan . The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis . And then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis .

On top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this modified this initial pattern .
When I went to the site , the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets , creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these courtyards . And for doing such a big project , the biggest project I &apos;ve ever designed , I really needed to understand the city of Tunis , but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture . And the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall , opened by twelve different gates , connected by almost straight lines .

It has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians . And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city . So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction .

And for that I thought , what would be the best orientation in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment ? The roof , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction . It has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians .

And it &apos;s north-south , because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation . And it also reinforces this idea of the gates . And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city .
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor . And also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing . So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction .



And also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing . The volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the courtyards there are the different facilities , such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by , a series of commercial &#91; spaces &#93; that bring activity to the ground floor . And also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor .
In these cities , the impact of architecture in people &apos;s lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow .
And also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .


I think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .


I think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived . So what I &apos;m going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter . I think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .

The second is an aim : we should have more trust . And I think there are three .

I think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived .
And the third is a task : we should rebuild trust . So what I &apos;m going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter . The second is an aim : we should have more trust .

First the claim : Why do people think trust has declined ? But , of course , I can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined .



I &apos;m inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others .

So they &apos;re looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions . When you actually look at opinion polls across time , there &apos;s not much evidence for that . And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses .






Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ? Now if somebody said to you , &quot; Do you trust greengrocers ? Do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot;
Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ? Do you trust fishmongers ? Now if somebody said to you , &quot; Do you trust greengrocers ?
And you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; Well , I trust some of them , but not others . &quot; Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ? Do you trust fishmongers ?

Do you trust fishmongers ? Now if somebody said to you , &quot; Do you trust greengrocers ? Do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot;
And you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; Well , I trust some of them , but not others . &quot;
We don &apos;t make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform .

I might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver . In short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differentiated way . We don &apos;t make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform .

I might , for example , say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read , but in no way to drive the school minibus . So if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ?
Secondly , what about the aim ? The aim is to have more trust . Well frankly , I think that &apos;s a stupid aim .


So if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ? I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy . Well frankly , I think that &apos;s a stupid aim .
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy . So if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ? I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust .
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life . And I think , of those people who , for example , placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff , who then made off with them , and I think of them , and I think , well , yes , too much trust . I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust .

It &apos;s not what I would aim at . In fact , I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy . Secondly , what about the aim ?
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy . More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life . The aim is to have more trust .

Well frankly , I think that &apos;s a stupid aim . I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy . And I think , of those people who , for example , placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff , who then made off with them , and I think of them , and I think , well , yes , too much trust .

Are they competent ? Are they honest ? Are they reliable ? And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be trustworthy . But if , on the other hand , they &apos;re unreliable , we might not .

I have friends who are competent and honest , but I would not trust them to post a letter , because they &apos;re forgetful . And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be trustworthy . And I &apos;m very glad to say , I don &apos;t think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest .

And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be trustworthy . Are they competent ? Are they honest ? Are they reliable ? It &apos;s judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects .

A lot of these systems have the converse effect . Across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness . But that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for : trustworthiness before trust .


Across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness .






The aim , I think , is more trustworthiness , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people , and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy . And all over our public life , our institutional life , we find that problem , that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite . I remember I was talking with a midwife who said , &quot; Well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby . &quot;

I remember I was talking with a midwife who said , &quot; Well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby . &quot; Calling the task rebuilding trust , I think , also gets things backwards .

It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks , like midwives , from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes , as we say . So so much for the aim .
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust . We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness . We can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
Calling the task rebuilding trust , I think , also gets things backwards . We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness . You can &apos;t rebuild what other people give you .

You can &apos;t rebuild what other people give you . It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust . Calling the task rebuilding trust , I think , also gets things backwards .


We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness . It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust . But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .

But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy . You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust . But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .
Well every day , all over the place , it &apos;s being done by ordinary people , by officials , by institutions , quite effectively . But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust . So you have to , I think , be trustworthy . But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .


The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back , and they don &apos;t ask any questions . They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted .


If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying .

That &apos;s super . I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me . It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy . So the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls , much more about being trustworthy , and how you give people adequate , useful and simple evidence that you &apos;re trustworthy .

You know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; together .


Forty years later was when the trend really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy &apos;s guards . But &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; stood alone . I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; together .


But you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is . Now we live today , and are raising our children , in a kind of children &apos;s-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex . Her favorite character was Glinda , of course .



Forty years later was when the trend really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy &apos;s guards .

One is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot;



He was only three at the time .
Another thing that &apos;s really unique about &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female . The monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .


At that point I also had a son . He was only three at the time . But he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted .

And I wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
So he wandered in , and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling , and I don &apos;t think he understands what &apos;s going on , but he is sure soaking in it .

Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru , and of course this princess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe , which he does by the magic that he was born with ? That &apos;s kind of the world I &apos;d rather raise my kids in -- Oz , right ? -- and not the world of dudes fighting , which is where we kind of have to be . Compare this to 1939 with &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot;




There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . It &apos;s very good . I haven &apos;t read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe .

Why is there so much Force -- capital F , Force -- in the movies we have for our kids , and so little yellow brick road ?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . It &apos;s very good .





But they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience . There &apos;s no models for them . I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy , but they are not necessarily showing boys how they &apos;re supposed to defend against the patriarchy .


And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are , these are still war movies .


&quot; Aw , I can &apos;t believe Pixar made a princess movie . &quot; There are plenty of exceptions , and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you . And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are , these are still war movies .

Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .


I recommend it to all of you . It &apos;s on demand now . And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ? Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .
Until , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; Brave . &quot;

And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ? Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid- &apos; 80s , she recorded this conversation she &apos;d had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw . Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ? Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ? So try to meet that bar . Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid- &apos; 80s , she recorded this conversation she &apos;d had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw .
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ? Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test . Thank you very much .




And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?


And I don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis .





Eleven . It &apos;s not bad . It &apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just elected to Congress , so that &apos;s good . It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test .

One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life .

I don &apos;t even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when I hear that statistic , one of the things I think of is that &apos;s a lot of sexual assailants . Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fault of popular entertainment . I don &apos;t think kids &apos; movies have anything to do with that .





What are they failing to learn ? Are they absorbing the story that a male hero &apos;s job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn &apos;t speak ? We have tools at our disposal like &quot; girl power , &quot; and we hope that that will help , but I gotta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , actively or passively , we are training our sons to maintain their boy power ?

Are we soaking up that story ? Who are these guys ? What are they learning ? What are they failing to learn ?

The definition of manhood is already turning upside down .



What do these two have in common ? I think these people are experts . I like that kind of quest for my daughter , and I like that kind of quest for my son .

Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda .









I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid . With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia . He lives in a small village in southern Somalia .
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid . He lives in a small village in southern Somalia . Drought drives the small village into poverty and to the brink of starvation .
With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia . He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu . He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .

He ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of Mogadishu . He eventually gets married . With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .

One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast . When he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .

One day , he &apos;s approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast . He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break . He starts this new life .
He is introduced to this young woman . He starts this new life . He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He eventually gets married . He meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break . He is introduced to this young woman .

This was the first thing that pulled him out of what we call waithood . So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blowing himself up ? He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .


He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along . One beautiful day in Mogadishu , under an azure blue sky , a car bomb goes off .
For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .

For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities . If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of waithood , the gateway to terrorism , to violence , to gangs , will be the story of cities 2.0 . By 2030 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities .

And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment . He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along . It is the story of the disenfranchised , unemployed urban youth who sparks riots in Johannesburg , sparks riots in London , who reaches out for something other than waithood .





My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .
And in my city of birth , Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment . 70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .

What if I had been forced into that same state of waithood ? I remember standing in front of that bullet-ridden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ? We sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .

I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders .
He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated . My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit . One of the young men in the room was Aden .

He went to university in Mogadishu , graduated . I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited . My reason for being in Mogadishu that month was actually to host a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit .

They sought people like him out .

They sought people like him out . There were no jobs , no opportunities . Aden saw an opportunity and seized it .

What makes his story different ? I believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity . It &apos;s entrepreneurship , and I believe entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against waithood .
How is this story different ?








And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years . There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu . I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings , Mohamed Mohamoud , a florist .

And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years . He was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .

There &apos;s no public park in Mogadishu .
And he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mogadishu &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mohamed &apos;s presence had a really profound impact on the youth in that room .
He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu , and started growing tulips and lilies , which he said could survive the harsh Mogadishu climate . He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity . They &apos;ve thought about working for an NGO , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .

By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city . He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
They had never really thought about starting up a business . He empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .

Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth . So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality . For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business .
For me , entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business . It &apos;s about creating a social impact . They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses .

So inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
By the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city . His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city . They came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .



Mohamed is not simply selling flowers . His Peace Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city . Connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
I believe he is selling hope .
So my suggestion is , turn youth into entrepreneurs , incubate and nurture their inherent innovation , and you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks than of car bombs and waithood . These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities . He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of waithood .







And eventually when I started studying Egyptology , I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn &apos;t enough . I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them . This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
When I was a child growing up in Maine , one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine , because my parents told me it would bring me luck . But you know , these shells , they &apos;re hard to find . This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
But you know , these shells , they &apos;re hard to find . However , overtime , I got used to looking for them . When I was a child growing up in Maine , one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine , because my parents told me it would bring me luck .
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared .

So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared . For trying to map the past , I knew that I had to see differently .
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared . This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery . This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians . And the site visibly appears brown , but when we use the infrared and we process it , all of the sudden , using false color , the site appears as bright pink . Because all of the sudden in Egypt my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long next to the Nile , and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities .
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art , architecture and religion . Itjtawy was ancient Egypt &apos;s capital for over four hundred years , at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago . What I want to share with you today is how we &apos;ve used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city , called Itjtawy , missing for thousands of years .


Itjtawy was ancient Egypt &apos;s capital for over four hundred years , at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago . The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art , architecture and religion . What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians .





Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it , indicated within the red circles here , but somewhere within this massive flood plane . So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists to do coring work , which you see here . But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here , which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy .
So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape , very subtle changes . But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here , which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy . So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists to do coring work , which you see here .

Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it , indicated within the red circles here , but somewhere within this massive flood plane .


We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow . What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is . These might not look like much , but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom , these are the stones that were used .


But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here , which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy . And five meters down , underneath a thick layer of mud , we found a dense layer of pottery .


What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is . And five meters down , underneath a thick layer of mud , we found a dense layer of pottery . We also found work stone -- carnelian , quartz and agate that shows that there was a jewelers workshop here .
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is . So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago . These might not look like much , but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom , these are the stones that were used .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site . We also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop , showing that whatever was there was a very important city . What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is .


So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago . And even more importantly , we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well . So as it turns out , TED was not founded in 1984 AD .


So as it turns out , TED was not founded in 1984 AD . So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago .
&quot; Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings . Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city , found from above .


And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
Several years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge . The marshmallow has to be on top . And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .

And since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .



And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop . But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse . And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .

So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! -- they admire their work . Then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti . So , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .

They lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! -- they admire their work . But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh-oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse . And of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all . And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta-da ! -- they admire their work .





And then they execute on it . What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way . They don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .




Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process . And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work . And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?

Designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process . Architects and engineers , thankfully .
So the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults . What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .

What kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way . So CEOs , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting . So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .

And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work . And why is it ? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .


And why is it ? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures . Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I &apos;ve seen .
And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I &apos;ve seen . If you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better . Because they have special skills of facilitation .

Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .

They manage the process , they understand the process . If you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better . So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
If you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
Because they have special skills of facilitation . Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success . And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
And any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance . They manage the process , they understand the process . Because they have special skills of facilitation .




If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize . We did the exercise again with the same students . So what do you think happened to these design students ?



So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best . They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time . So now they understand the value of prototyping .

We did the exercise again with the same students .
Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ? So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ? So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high stakes have a strong impact .

The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype . And the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects . So now they understand the value of prototyping .

And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise . And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.

And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions . And those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .



It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows . There &apos;s step-by-step instructions on this . There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .

And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta-da &quot; moment .







A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters . I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful . Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters .

I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful .
I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful . A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters . Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy . You are ready ? A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy . I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful . Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters . The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters . You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy . Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .

Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works . Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square . Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way .
You get a mouth . Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .













The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped . If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; It was this big . &quot; As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .


He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale .

Three trees together , we create the forest .
One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods . Two fires together , I get really hot . Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; idiot . &quot; One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods . Three trees together , we create the forest .
Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation . One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods . Two fires together , I get really hot .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames . Two suns together , prosperous . Three together , that &apos;s sparkles .
Two fires together , I get really hot . Three together , that &apos;s sparkles . Two suns together , prosperous .
Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; idiot . &quot; For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .

For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames . Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness . It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
Set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning . Three together , that &apos;s sparkles . Two suns together , prosperous .
Three together , that &apos;s sparkles . Two suns together , prosperous .

Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness . Two women together , they have an argument . On the left , we have a woman .
A door . Put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt .

Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery .


Two women together , they have an argument . By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 . So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old .



This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China . We know Japan is the land of the rising sun . So a sun , origin together , we build Japan .
By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 . The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 . We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .

A person behind Japan , what do we get ? This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China . A Japanese person .

For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano . This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China . So after we know the characters , we start building phrases .

This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China . So a sun , origin together , we build Japan . We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .

A person behind Japan , what do we get ? So a sun , origin together , we build Japan . This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .



And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room . Because 30 years ago , I &apos;m from Jersey , and I was six , and I lived there in my parents &apos; house in a town called Livingston , and this was my childhood bedroom .

And that &apos;s where everyone would hang out and watch TV , so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom , everyone would see me , and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel , everyone would see me . That &apos;s a lot to pack into 18 minutes .
It &apos;s a complex topic , so we &apos;re just going to dive right in at a complex place : New Jersey .




Around the corner from my bedroom was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister . And that &apos;s where everyone would hang out and watch TV , so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom , everyone would see me , and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel , everyone would see me . And in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room .



That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn &apos;t even realize . I hated that walk , I hated that balcony , I hated that room , and I hated that house .
And it &apos;s no surprise that we feel that way , because according to the EPA , Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors . I was awkward , insecure , and I hated it . I hated that walk , I hated that balcony , I hated that room , and I hated that house .
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn &apos;t even realize . It means that when I show you a building like this , I know what you think : You think &quot; power &quot; and &quot; stability &quot; and &quot; democracy . &quot; That &apos;s 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture .

It &apos;s a predictable emotional connection , and we &apos;ve been using this trick for a long , long time .
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn &apos;t even realize . This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of .

This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of . It means that when I show you a building like this , I know what you think : You think &quot; power &quot; and &quot; stability &quot; and &quot; democracy . &quot; That makes us a little bit gullible and very , very predictable .
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums . And in the 20th century in America , we used it to build houses . This is really , really useful , because building things is terrifying .



And the people that build things -- developers and governments -- they &apos;re naturally afraid of innovation , and they &apos;d rather just use those forms that they know you &apos;ll respond to . And in the 20th century in America , we used it to build houses . We used it &#91; 200 &#93; years ago to build banks .



But it doesn &apos;t have much to do with what a library actually does today . And look at these solid , stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements . That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , another library was completed , and it looks like this .




This library is about how we consume media in a digital age . But it doesn &apos;t have much to do with what a library actually does today . That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , another library was completed , and it looks like this .


So we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like sellouts , so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years .
So we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like sellouts , so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years . On the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new typologies , new solutions for the way that we live today . So how is it possible that in the same year , in the same country , two buildings , both called libraries , look so completely different ?
It &apos;s about a new kind of public amenity for the city , a place to gather and read and share . On the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new typologies , new solutions for the way that we live today . So we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like sellouts , so we start experimenting again and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years .
We have to go to the other side and reengage those symbols that we know you love . We wear all black , we get very depressed , you think we &apos;re adorable , we &apos;re dead inside because we &apos;ve got no choice . On the one side is innovation , and architects are constantly pushing , pushing for new technologies , new typologies , new solutions for the way that we live today .




Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism . It &apos;s about concrete . Okay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the &apos; 70s .

We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials . So as we get closer to the &apos; 80s , we start to reengage those symbols . We take these forms that we know you love and we update them .
And you love it . We take Chippendale armoires and we turned those into skyscrapers , and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass . We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials .


And you love it . Forms got big , forms got bold and colorful . But it &apos;s the &apos; 80s , it &apos;s cool .

We add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials . This is the thing about symbols . This is the thing about postmodernism .
Forms got big , forms got bold and colorful . It was crazy . They &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .
But it &apos;s the &apos; 80s , it &apos;s cool . Forms got big , forms got bold and colorful . Because I know , and I know all of you know , this isn &apos;t Tuscany .
Forms got big , forms got bold and colorful . It was crazy . They &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .


This is the thing about postmodernism .



They &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making memories of places .
In the late &apos; 80s and early &apos; 90s , we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism . And this building fundamentally changes the world &apos;s relationship to architecture .


Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed . And this building fundamentally changes the world &apos;s relationship to architecture . The New York Times called this building a miracle .




And this building fundamentally changes the world &apos;s relationship to architecture . He is our very first starchitect . This is the Guggenheim Bilbao , by Frank Gehry .


So every mayor knew that if they had these forms , they had culture and tourism . So did every mayor in the world .
Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed . And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism . So did every mayor in the world .

And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism .

Technology speeds up : You can see it in a newspaper , on TV , until finally , we are all architectural photographers , and the building has become disembodied from the site . Architecture is everywhere now , and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture . Transportation speeds up : You can take a boat , you can take a plane , you can be a tourist .

Technology speeds up : You can see it in a newspaper , on TV , until finally , we are all architectural photographers , and the building has become disembodied from the site . Because architecture actually moves quite quickly . Architecture is everywhere now , and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture .
Transportation speeds up : You can take a boat , you can take a plane , you can be a tourist . Because architecture actually moves quite quickly . It takes a long time to build a building , three or four years , and in the interim , an architect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not .
Transportation speeds up : You can take a boat , you can take a plane , you can be a tourist . A thousand years ago , you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building . Technology speeds up : You can see it in a newspaper , on TV , until finally , we are all architectural photographers , and the building has become disembodied from the site .







So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum , it starts swinging faster and faster , until it &apos;s at both extremes nearly simultaneously , and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol , between us , the architects , and you , the public . It &apos;s never going to happen again , I think , because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete , of steel , or of the elevator , and it &apos;s a media revolution .

Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my firm recently completed . But that meant that two years before the building was complete , it was already a part of the community , so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product , there were no surprises . This building was already a part of this community , and then that first summer , when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media , the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media , because these , these are not just pictures of a building , they &apos;re your pictures of a building .




But that meant that two years before the building was complete , it was already a part of the community , so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product , there were no surprises .










It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works . It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn , not some red-brick historical pastiche of what we think a stadium ought to be . This is the end of architectural history , and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today .
Let &apos;s be a part of this . Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings , and you aren &apos;t the hapless public , the consumer that won &apos;t accept anything that they haven &apos;t seen anymore . Everything is different now .
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use big words and complicated drawings , and you aren &apos;t the hapless public , the consumer that won &apos;t accept anything that they haven &apos;t seen anymore . Architects can hear you , and you &apos;re not intimidated by architecture . And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around .
Architects can hear you , and you &apos;re not intimidated by architecture . It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little reindeer pavilion that &apos;s as muscly and sinewy as the animals it &apos;s designed to observe .

We &apos;ve just been waiting for all of you to want them . Find an architect , hire an architect , work with us to design better buildings , better cities , and a better world , because the stakes are high . Because it doesn &apos;t matter if a cow builds our buildings or a robot builds our buildings .



Thank you . Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener and smarter and friendlier . Find an architect , hire an architect , work with us to design better buildings , better cities , and a better world , because the stakes are high .


And she &apos;s walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do , a kind of teetering , my-body &apos;s-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way . She giggles and squeals , and gives herself these big , wet kisses .
She &apos;s just turned one and started to walk .
This is my niece , Stella . She absolutely loves her reflection . And she &apos;s walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do , a kind of teetering , my-body &apos;s-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way .



Because apparently we don &apos;t . And she &apos;s slightly dreading it , and she &apos;s a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she &apos;s beautiful , every day at school , someone tells her that she &apos;s ugly . Ten thousand people every month google , &quot; Am I ugly ? &quot;
Ten thousand people every month google , &quot; Am I ugly ? &quot; And she &apos;s slightly dreading it , and she &apos;s a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she &apos;s beautiful , every day at school , someone tells her that she &apos;s ugly . And like any teenager , she just wants to be liked and to fit in .
And she &apos;s slightly dreading it , and she &apos;s a bit confused because despite her mom telling her all the time that she &apos;s beautiful , every day at school , someone tells her that she &apos;s ugly . When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look ? She absolutely loves her reflection .







This always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive .


And the social pressures that go along with that are relentless . There &apos;s no separation between online and offline life .
Well , today &apos;s teenagers are rarely alone . This always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of likes they get and the types of comments that they receive . They &apos;re under pressure to be online and available at all times , talking , messaging , liking , commenting , sharing , posting - it never ends .





And trends like # thinspiration , # thighgap , # bikinibridge and # proana . These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today &apos;s popular culture . For those who don &apos;t know , # proana means pro-anorexia .
These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today &apos;s popular culture . And trends like # thinspiration , # thighgap , # bikinibridge and # proana . Size zero models still dominate our catwalks .

And trends like # thinspiration , # thighgap , # bikinibridge and # proana .
Well , surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy , well balanced individuals . Well , you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds of girls today . But boys are not immune to this either .

It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against . These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification of women in today &apos;s popular culture . And trends like # thinspiration , # thighgap , # bikinibridge and # proana .


But , what &apos;s the problem with all of this ? These are not trivial activities . These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce .

But in an image-obsessed culture , we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities . One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don &apos;t feel good about it . Thirty-one percent , nearly one in three teenagers , are withdrawing from classroom debate . They &apos;re failing to engage in classroom debate because they don &apos;t want to draw attention to the way that they look .
And when it comes to exams , if you don &apos;t think you look good enough , specifically if you don &apos;t think you are thin enough , you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this .

These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce . So , things like their relationships , the development of their physical abilities , and their studies and so on begin to suffer .

So to be super clear , we &apos;re talking about the way you think you look , not how you actually look . And when it comes to exams , if you don &apos;t think you look good enough , specifically if you don &apos;t think you are thin enough , you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this . But in an image-obsessed culture , we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities .

Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don &apos;t think they look good enough . So to be super clear , we &apos;re talking about the way you think you look , not how you actually look. and China , and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh .

Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders . And when it comes to exams , if you don &apos;t think you look good enough , specifically if you don &apos;t think you are thin enough , you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this . Thirty-one percent , nearly one in three teenagers , are withdrawing from classroom debate . They &apos;re failing to engage in classroom debate because they don &apos;t want to draw attention to the way that they look .

Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders . And when it comes to exams , if you don &apos;t think you look good enough , specifically if you don &apos;t think you are thin enough , you will score a lower grade point average than your peers who are not concerned with this . Women who think they &apos;re overweight - again , regardless of whether they are or are not - have higher rates of absenteeism .
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement . Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders .


Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders . Seventeen percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren &apos;t feeling confident about the way that they look . So to be super clear , we &apos;re talking about the way you think you look , not how you actually look .
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement . Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders .

Have a think about what this is doing to our economy . Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and vegetables , partake in more unhealthy weight control practices that can lead to eating disorders . It &apos;s not enough by itself .


And we &apos;ve learned there are three key ways : The first is we have to educate for body confidence . But how do we do that ? Have a think about what this is doing to our economy .


We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome image-related pressures and build their self-esteem . So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact , but having a lasting impact as well . Now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .


And the research shows that the best programs address six key areas : The first is the influence of family , friends and relationships . Now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .
And we &apos;ve learned there are three key ways : The first is we have to educate for body confidence .
It is not okay that we judge the contribution of our politicians by their haircuts or the size of their breasts , or to infer that the determination or the success of an Olympian is down to her not being a looker . I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse .
Now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this . I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse . The bad news is that most of them don &apos;t work .


So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact , but having a lasting impact as well . Ultimately , we need to work together as communities , as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves , valuing individuality , diversity , inclusion . The second is media and celebrity culture , then how to handle teasing and bullying , the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks , talking about appearance - some people call this &quot; body talk &quot; or &quot; fat talk &quot; - and finally , the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself .

Challenging the status quo of how women are seen and talked about in our own circles .

We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comments that we post on our own social networks .
Ultimately , we need to work together as communities , as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves , valuing individuality , diversity , inclusion . We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pedestals , making a difference in the real world . Giving them the airtime , because only then will we create a different world .

Let &apos;s build self-esteem into our school curriculums .

Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant .
On November 5th , 1990 , a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane , the leader of the Jewish Defense League . Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant .

Thankfully , those plans were foiled by an FBI informant . I was born in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania in 1983 to him , an Egyptian engineer , and a loving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me . It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .








That day , the last bullet I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target burst into flames .




Those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center &apos;s North Tower , causing an explosion that killed six people and injured over 1,000 others . For those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world . So what opened my eyes ?


For those reasons , my social skills were lacking , to say the least , and growing up in a bigoted household , I wasn &apos;t prepared for the real world . So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games . Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to pack up and move to the next town .
One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections . Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia . The members of our group came from many different walks of life .




There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character . One of my first experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections .

Through a college prep program , I was able to take part in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia . One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold dear to my heart for as long as I live . One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish .

One day toward the end of the convention , I found out that one of the kids I had befriended was Jewish . There , I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures , and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character . Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .

In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you .

Zak Ebrahim is not my real name .

And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father . So why would I out myself and potentially put myself in danger ? Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bigotry .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives . And with that simple fact , I stand here as proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father . For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these senseless acts and condemn my father &apos;s actions .

I can &apos;t be certain that you guys are conscious . Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence . At least , I know about my consciousness directly .
If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value . At least , I know about my consciousness directly . Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value . Consciousness also is what makes life worth living .
There &apos;s nothing we know about more directly . But at the same time , it &apos;s the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe .
If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value . Each of us is conscious . Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions . Each of us is conscious . I &apos;m going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science , some radical ideas may be needed .

Consciousness , by its nature , is subjective . Psychologists studied behavior objectively , neuroscientists studied the brain objectively , and nobody even mentioned consciousness . For much of the 20th century , that view held sway .



Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness . And since then , there &apos;s been a real explosion , a flowering of scientific work on consciousness .

But it also has some fundamental limitations so far . Even 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness . And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .

Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness .

We saw some of this kind of work from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented just a few minutes ago .
And since then , there &apos;s been a real explosion , a flowering of scientific work on consciousness . Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy . Even 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness .
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they correlate with .

There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do . But this is still a science of correlations .
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness . It &apos;s not a science of explanations . But it doesn &apos;t address the real mystery at the core of this subject : why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all ?

But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems . It &apos;s not a science of explanations .

You could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as emergent phenomena : how we walk , how we talk , how we play chess , all these questions about behavior . But it doesn &apos;t address the real mystery at the core of this subject : why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all ? There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .



When it comes to the hard problem , that &apos;s the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience ?

When it comes to the hard problem , that &apos;s the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience ?
But when it comes to consciousness , questions about behavior are among the easy problems . I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work . The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior , how a traffic jam behaves , how a hurricane functions , how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes , all questions about objective functioning .

I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work . And here , the standard paradigm of emergence , even the standard paradigms of neuroscience , don &apos;t really , so far , have that much to say . The classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior , how a traffic jam behaves , how a hurricane functions , how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes , all questions about objective functioning .
Now , I &apos;m a scientific materialist at heart .
We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great chain of explanation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics explains chemistry , chemistry explains biology , biology explains parts of psychology . And here , the standard paradigm of emergence , even the standard paradigms of neuroscience , don &apos;t really , so far , have that much to say . But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture .



But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture . Faced with an anomaly like this , radical ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically . So I think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly , one that we need to integrate into our view of the world , but we don &apos;t yet see how .

The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands . In the time remaining , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise . Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks : space and time and mass .
In the 19th century , Maxwell figured out that you can &apos;t explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals - space , time , mass , Newton &apos;s laws - so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental element that those laws govern . Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands . They postulate fundamental laws governing them , like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics .

These fundamental properties and laws aren &apos;t explained in terms of anything more basic . Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands .

These fundamental properties and laws aren &apos;t explained in terms of anything more basic . The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature . The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
This doesn &apos;t mean you suddenly can &apos;t do science with it . If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals - space , time , mass , charge - then as a matter of logic , you need to expand the list . They postulate fundamental laws governing them , like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics .

What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals : space , time , mass , physical processes . Now sometimes , the list of fundamentals expands .

If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals - space , time , mass , charge - then as a matter of logic , you need to expand the list .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-shirt . What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals : space , time , mass , physical processes . The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature .

Physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt . What we then need is to study the fundamental laws governing consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundamentals : space , time , mass , physical processes . Even a photon has some degree of consciousness .

This view is sometimes called panpsychism : pan for all , psych for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mice , flies , but even Rob Knight &apos;s microbes , elementary particles . Every system might have some degree of consciousness .

Every system might have some degree of consciousness . Even a photon has some degree of consciousness . The idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking .

But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor to consciousness . Even a photon has some degree of consciousness . Every system might have some degree of consciousness .
I never get to slow down and smell the roses . &quot;
It &apos;s not that a photon is wracked with angst because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; Aww , I &apos;m always buzzing around near the speed of light .

I mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?

Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental . It &apos;s also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us , it &apos;s much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures , where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature .
If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are . I mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental . But the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw , subjective feeling , some primitive precursor to consciousness . A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing is to link consciousness to information .
If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are .


So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of phi , a whole lot of consciousness . A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist , Giulio Tononi , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory . Simple information processing , simple consciousness .
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist , Giulio Tononi , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory . So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of phi , a whole lot of consciousness . And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness .
He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi , measuring the amount of information integrated in a system .
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist , Giulio Tononi , has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously with a mathematical theory .

On Tononi &apos;s theory , there &apos;s still going to be a non-zero degree of consciousness . He has a mathematical measure of information integration which he calls phi , measuring the amount of information integrated in a system . And he supposes that phi goes along with consciousness .
So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of phi , a whole lot of consciousness .

But as you go down to worms , microbes , particles , the amount of phi falls off . In a mouse , medium degree of information integration , still pretty significant , pretty serious amount of consciousness . So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of phi , a whole lot of consciousness .
But as you go down to worms , microbes , particles , the amount of phi falls off . The amount of information integration falls off , but it &apos;s still non-zero .
So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integration , high degree of phi , a whole lot of consciousness . Now , I don &apos;t know if this theory is right , but it &apos;s actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness , and it &apos;s been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data , and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt . Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world .





That &apos;s what physics really is ultimately doing , describing the flux of consciousness . It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that underlies it .
Well , on the panpsychist view , you can leave the equations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness . Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world . It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that underlies it .


On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
So I think when you think about it , this tends to transfigure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness .

On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra . So I think when you think about it , this tends to transfigure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness . It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers .
I used to think I shouldn &apos;t eat anything which is conscious , so therefore I should be vegetarian .
If that &apos;s right , it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off . This view , I think , the panpsychist view , has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature , and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences .
Finally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups , the planet . Some of these may be counterintuitive .

Well , if you take the informational , panpsychist view , she certainly has complicated information processing and integration , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious . It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers . Finally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups , the planet .
Is she conscious ? It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers . So I think when you think about it , this tends to transfigure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness .
So I think when you think about it , this tends to transfigure your views , whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness .
I &apos;m actually more confident about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s universal . It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers .

Okay , so this panpsychist vision , it is a radical one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s correct . I mean , the view raises any number of questions , has any number of challenges , like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love .

I mean , the view raises any number of questions , has any number of challenges , like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love . If that &apos;s right , it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off . If not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy .



I mean , the view raises any number of questions , has any number of challenges , like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love . Understanding consciousness is a real key , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves .
If not , well , this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy . But I do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .

If we can answer those questions , then I think we &apos;re going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness .
We can &apos;t expect to solve it overnight .


I went to school , I hung out with my friends , I fought with my younger sisters . It was all very normal .

I had a very normal , low-key kind of upbringing . I went to school , I got good marks , I had a very low-key after school job in my mum &apos;s hairdressing salon , and I spent a lot of time watching &quot; Buffy the Vampire Slayer &quot; and &quot; Dawson &apos;s Creek . &quot; I went to school , I hung out with my friends , I fought with my younger sisters .
And my parents said , &quot; Hm , that &apos;s really nice , but there &apos;s kind of one glaring problem with that .
She hasn &apos;t actually achieved anything . &quot; And they were right , you know .
But they were right , you know . And when I was 15 , a member of my local community approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award . And my parents said , &quot; Hm , that &apos;s really nice , but there &apos;s kind of one glaring problem with that .


She hasn &apos;t actually achieved anything . &quot; And they were right , you know . And my parents said , &quot; Hm , that &apos;s really nice , but there &apos;s kind of one glaring problem with that .
You know , I &apos;d been talking them about defamation law for a good 20 minutes .


You know , when people in wheelchairs come to school , they usually say , like , inspirational stuff ? &quot; And I said , &quot; What speech ? &quot; Years later , I was on my second teaching round in a Melbourne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said , &quot; Hey miss , when are you going to start doing your speech ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; You know , like , your motivational speaking . And that &apos;s when it dawned on me : This kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects of inspiration . We &apos;re not real people . We are there to inspire .

For lots of us , disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists .

Right ? Yeah .

You may have seen images like this one : &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude . &quot;



You may have seen images like this one : &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude . &quot;




These are just a couple of examples , but there are a lot of these images out there . I &apos;ve lost count of the number of times that I &apos;ve been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think I &apos;m brave or inspirational , and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile . And these images , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call inspiration porn .




The purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motivate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; Well , however bad my life is , it could be worse .



I use the term &quot; disabled people &quot; quite deliberately , because I subscribe to what &apos;s called the social model of disability , which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses . These images , those images objectify disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people .
But the things that we &apos;re overcoming are not the things that you think they are . I use the term &quot; disabled people &quot; quite deliberately , because I subscribe to what &apos;s called the social model of disability , which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses . And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult .
We do overcome some things . And life as a disabled person is actually somewhat difficult . I use the term &quot; disabled people &quot; quite deliberately , because I subscribe to what &apos;s called the social model of disability , which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses .


It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pictures as well . So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do , to share those images ?
So I have lived in this body a long time . It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pictures as well . So is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do , to share those images ?







People , when they say , &quot; You &apos;re an inspiration , &quot; they mean it as a compliment .

It &apos;s because of the lie , it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional . I really think that this lie that we &apos;ve been sold about disability is the greatest injustice . We are learning from each others &apos; strength and endurance , not against our bodies and our diagnoses , but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us .



I learn from other disabled people all the time . I &apos;m learning not that I am luckier than them , though . I am learning that it &apos;s a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped . I &apos;m learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery .

I really think that this lie that we &apos;ve been sold about disability is the greatest injustice . And that quote , &quot; The only disability in life is a bad attitude , &quot; the reason that that &apos;s bullshit is because it &apos;s just not true , because of the social model of disability . I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception , but the norm .

I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people , and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user . I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl sitting in her bedroom watching &quot; Buffy the Vampire Slayer &quot; isn &apos;t referred to as achieving anything because she &apos;s doing it sitting down . I want to live in a world where we don &apos;t have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning .

Augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime , and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen , and people need to be aware of that , because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone . When most people think about augmented reality , they think about &quot; Minority Report &quot; and Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air , but augmented reality is not science fiction . Now how do we get to augmented reality ?

When most people think about augmented reality , they think about &quot; Minority Report &quot; and Tom Cruise waving his hands in the air , but augmented reality is not science fiction . What do augmented reality and professional football have to do with empathy ?




I have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination . With Google Glass , we can put that underneath a helmet , and we can get a sense of what it &apos;s like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour , your blood pounding in your ears . What you may not be familiar with is that Google Glass is a device that will allow you to see what I see .

I have to use words . And I &apos;ve been on the receiving end of that , and it doesn &apos;t feel very good . Right now , the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you .




Go ! Hold on , let &apos;s get a little closer . Now , you may have noticed there are some people missing there : the rest of the team .
Go .
Quarterback : Hey , Mice 54 ! Mice 54 ! All right , ready ? Now , you may have noticed there are some people missing there : the rest of the team .
Go ! Blue 8 ! Blue 8 ! Go ! Now , you may have noticed there are some people missing there : the rest of the team .
Blue 8 ! Blue 8 ! Go ! Go . Hold on , let &apos;s get a little closer .



Go ! All right , ready ? We have some video of that courtesy of the University of Washington .



Fans want to be on that field . Fans want that experience . Well , once we have that experience with GoPro and Google Glass , how do we make it more immersive ?
Fans want that experience . Fans want to be on that field .

I &apos;m going to show you why that is not empty hype with this video .
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created , and that is not empty hype .



What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour as an Olympic downhill skier ?
No ! No ! No ! I don &apos;t want to play anymore ! No !

We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see , and they say , &quot; How do we use this to make our teams better ? How do we get to augmented reality , A.R. ? This is only virtual reality , V.R.
How do we get to augmented reality , A.R. ? But this is not yet augmented reality .

Because teams always use technology to win games . They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year . We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see , and they say , &quot; How do we use this to make our teams better ?
They like winning . It makes them money . They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year . So a brief history of technology in the NFL .
Other teams followed suit . How do we use this to win games ? &quot; More people watched the game because it was more exciting .
We get to augmented reality when coaches and managers and owners look at this information streaming in that people want to see , and they say , &quot; How do we use this to make our teams better ? Because teams always use technology to win games . It was faster .



More people watched games because it was faster . In 1994 , the NFL put helmet radios into the helmets of the quarterbacks , and later the defense . They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year .
More people watched games because it was faster . It was more entertaining . No more having to worry about forgetting plays .

It was faster . More people watched the game because it was more exciting . It was more entertaining .
More people watched the game because it was more exciting . More people watched games because it was faster . It was faster .

No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook . In 2023 , imagine you &apos;re a player walking back to the huddle , and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now . It was more entertaining .

In 2023 , imagine you &apos;re a player walking back to the huddle , and you have your next play displayed right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor that you already wear right now .
No more having to worry about forgetting plays .

And coaches really want this , because missed assignments lose you games , and coaches hate losing games . No more having to worry about forgetting plays . Losing games gets you fired as a coach .
Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game . You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers , technology that &apos;s being worked on right now . Well , a very simple setup would be a camera on each corner of the stadium looking down , giving you a bird &apos;s-eye view of all the people down there .
But augmented reality is not just an enhanced playbook .



The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use . Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to enhance how you play the game . You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers , technology that &apos;s being worked on right now .
The bad ones have information overload . You take all that information , and you stream it to your players . That determines good teams from bad .
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use . You take all that information , and you stream it to your players . You also have information from helmet sensors and accelerometers , technology that &apos;s being worked on right now .

It &apos;s also for jocks . Who knew ? You &apos;re scanning downfield for an open receiver .
And now , your I.T. department is just as important as your scouting department , and data-mining is not for nerds anymore . That determines good teams from bad . The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use .

What would that look like on the field ?
All of a sudden , a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know , blind side linebacker is blitzing in . You &apos;re scanning downfield for an open receiver . What would that look like on the field ?
All of a sudden , a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know , blind side linebacker is blitzing in . Normally , you wouldn &apos;t be able to see him , but the augmented reality system lets you know . Another flash alerts you to an open receiver .



All of a sudden , a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know , blind side linebacker is blitzing in .
He goes , catches the ball , sprints in , touchdown . All of a sudden , a bright flash on the left side of your visor lets you know , blind side linebacker is blitzing in . Crowd goes wild , and the fans are with him every step of the way , watching from every perspective .

The ball comes off track . You throw the ball , but you &apos;re hit right as you throw . Another flash alerts you to an open receiver .
Now this is something that will create massive excitement in the game .


It will make tons of people watch , because people want this experience .
He goes , catches the ball , sprints in , touchdown . Augmented reality will be a part of sports , because it &apos;s too profitable not to . Crowd goes wild , and the fans are with him every step of the way , watching from every perspective .

Fans want to be on the field . It will make tons of people watch , because people want this experience .


Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more . What is this technology worth to a gay Ugandan or Russian trying to show the world what it &apos;s like living under persecution ? It &apos;s worth revenue , to the tune of billions of dollars a year .
I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself , by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person &apos;s shoes . But the question I ask you is , is that &apos;s all that we &apos;re content to use augmented reality for ? Augmented reality will be a part of sports , because it &apos;s too profitable not to .
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more . Augmented reality will be a part of sports , because it &apos;s too profitable not to . Ladies and gentlemen , augmented reality is coming .

What is this technology worth to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians ? It &apos;s worth revenue , to the tune of billions of dollars a year .
We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues .

I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service .




Joseph Strauss , chief engineer in charge of building the bridge , was quoted as saying , &quot; The bridge is practically suicide-proof .




Those that don &apos;t generally flail in the water helplessly , and then drown . I don &apos;t think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face . Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable . &quot;




I don &apos;t think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face . I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life . Those that don &apos;t generally flail in the water helplessly , and then drown .
I don &apos;t think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face . I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life .
This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide , but to the officers as well . I don &apos;t think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face . Except for around the two towers , there is 32 inches of steel paralleling the bridge .


This was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide , but to the officers as well . When I first began working on the bridge , we had no formal training . I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail .


When I first began working on the bridge , we had no formal training . We &apos;ve come a long , long way since then . After about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora &apos;s box .

After about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora &apos;s box . Well one day , curiosity got the better of Pandora , and she did open the box . Recalling your Greek mythology , Zeus created Pandora , and sent her down to Earth with a box , and told her , &quot; Never , ever open that box . &quot;
I met Jason on July 22 of last year when I get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near midspan .




The only good thing in the box was hope . Recalling your Greek mythology , Zeus created Pandora , and sent her down to Earth with a box , and told her , &quot; Never , ever open that box . &quot; He paused a few moments , leaned to his right , and was gone .
Out flew plagues , sorrows , and all sorts of evils against man .
After about an hour of speaking with Jason , he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora &apos;s box . He paused a few moments , leaned to his right , and was gone . I spoke with Jason &apos;s parents that evening , and I suppose that , when I was speaking with them , that I didn &apos;t sound as if I was doing very well , because that very next day , their family rabbi called to check on me .

This kind , intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide . The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people . Don &apos;t argue , blame , or tell the person you know how they feel , because you probably don &apos;t .
I spoke with Jason &apos;s parents that evening , and I suppose that , when I was speaking with them , that I didn &apos;t sound as if I was doing very well , because that very next day , their family rabbi called to check on me . Would you know what to say ? This kind , intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide .


Don &apos;t argue , blame , or tell the person you know how they feel , because you probably don &apos;t . I pose these questions to you : What would you do if your family member , friend or loved one was suicidal ? By just being there , you may just be the turning point that they need .


One way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot; Confronting the person head-on may just save their life and be the turning point for them . Some other signs to look for : hopelessness , believing that things are terrible and never going to get better ; helplessness , believing that there is nothing that you can do about it ; recent social withdrawal ; and a loss of interest in life .






&quot; Hi , Kevin . I imagine you &apos;re at the TED Conference .
Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .

Just wanted to drop you a note . She lost her son on January 19 of this year , and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago , and it &apos;s with her permission and blessing that I read this to you . I &apos;m thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend .
I &apos;m thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend . Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .



Hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
My prayers are with you for your fight .

I called Petaluma police and reported him missing that evening . A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1 : 58 p.m. the previous day . Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves .














You let me speak , and you just listened . &quot; But I asked him , &quot; What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? &quot; I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help .
When Kevin came back over , I congratulated him . He said , &quot; You listened .




Kevin is straight , as he says .

I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help . Today , Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society .





It &apos;s personal . This is what suicide does .
Suicide is not just something I &apos;ve encountered on the job . He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others . For most suicidal folks , or those contemplating suicide , they wouldn &apos;t think of hurting another person .

They just want their own pain to end . This is what suicide does . My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning .





This is what suicide does .

One was Jason . Of those incidents I &apos;ve been directly involved with , I &apos;ve only lost two , but that &apos;s two too many . And he leapt .





That connection , or bridge that we make , is something that each and every one of us should strive to do .




For complicated reasons which I &apos;ll get to later , when I look at this picture , at that time I felt like , Geena , you &apos;ve done it , you &apos;ve made it , you have arrived .


So when I became a fashion model , I felt that I &apos;d finally achieved the dream that I &apos;d always wanted since I was a young child . For complicated reasons which I &apos;ll get to later , when I look at this picture , at that time I felt like , Geena , you &apos;ve done it , you &apos;ve made it , you have arrived . But this past October , I realized that I &apos;m only just beginning .




All of us are put in boxes by our family , by our religion , by our society , our moment in history , even our own bodies . And my mom asked me , &quot; How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head ? &quot; I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house , I would always wear this t-shirt on my head .




In my case , for the last nine years , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , colleagues , even my agent , did not know about my history . I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house , I would always wear this t-shirt on my head . I said , &quot; Mom , this is my hair . I &apos;m a girl . &quot;
There &apos;s a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender . Because of my success , I never had the courage to share my story , not because I thought what I am is wrong , but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free . Many are not so fortunate .
I remember when I was five years old in the Philippines walking around our house , I would always wear this t-shirt on my head . I knew then how to self-identify . And my mom asked me , &quot; How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head ? &quot;


Because of my success , I never had the courage to share my story , not because I thought what I am is wrong , but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free .
Gender has always been considered a fact , immutable , but we now know it &apos;s actually more fluid , complex and mysterious .
There &apos;s a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender . So when I was eight years old , I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating these mysteries .

There &apos;s a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender . There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion . There is a Hindu goddess , hijra goddess .

Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women , but I &apos;ll take it . She is a transgender beauty pageant manager . There &apos;s a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender .

So from 15 to 17 years old , I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it &apos;s at the back of the truck , literally , or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field , and when it rains -- it rains a lot in the Philippines -- the organizers would have to move it inside someone &apos;s house . She is a transgender beauty pageant manager .



That night she asked me , &quot; How come you are not joining the beauty pageant ? &quot; But most importantly , I met some of my best friends in that community .


But then two weeks later she called me , she said , &quot; Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker ? &quot;
But then two weeks later she called me , she said , &quot; Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender marker ? &quot; In 2001 , my mom , who had moved to San Francisco , called me and told me that my green card petition came through , that I could now move to the United States . So from 15 to 17 years old , I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it &apos;s at the back of the truck , literally , or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field , and when it rains -- it rains a lot in the Philippines -- the organizers would have to move it inside someone &apos;s house .

I also experienced the goodness of strangers , especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the Philippines . In 2001 , my mom , who had moved to San Francisco , called me and told me that my green card petition came through , that I could now move to the United States . She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at 19 years old .




She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at 19 years old . So in 2001 , I moved to San Francisco , and I remember looking at my California driver &apos;s license with the name Geena and gender marker F. At that time in the United States , you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker .






She &apos;s from New York , she &apos;s a young woman who was courageously living her truth , but hatred ended her life .






My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am . Every November 20 , we have a global vigil for Transgender Day of Remembrance . I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror .


My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am . Today , this very moment , is my real coming out .




I &apos;m wondering what you would say , especially to parents , but in a more broad way , to friends , to family , to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that &apos;s being assigned them , what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them ?
Geena Rocero : Sure . Well , first , really , I &apos;m so blessed . I mean , we &apos;re all assigned gender at birth , so what I &apos;m trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn &apos;t match , and there should be a space that would allow people to self-identify , and that &apos;s a conversation that we should have with parents , with colleagues .
And sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn &apos;t , so - But it &apos;s just , gender identity is in the core of our being , right ?

And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child . In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies , fathers are usually known by their sons , but I &apos;m one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter , and I am proud of it . The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father .
The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father . And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child . When she gives birth to the second daughter , she is shocked , and in the expectation of a son , when she gives birth to a third daughter , she feels guilty like a criminal .
Ladies and gentlemen , if we glance to human history , the story of women is the story of injustice , inequality , violence and exploitation .
When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
She is not welcomed , neither by father nor by mother . Ladies and gentlemen , if we glance to human history , the story of women is the story of injustice , inequality , violence and exploitation .
When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
The neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother , and nobody congratulates the father . She can play with her friends in the streets , and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly .

When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad . And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child . Not only the mother suffers , but the daughter , the newly born daughter , when she grows old , she suffers too .




And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience . She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed . She is confined under the four walls of her home .



I know a family of seven sisters and one brother , and that one brother , he has migrated to the Gulf countries , to earn a living for his seven sisters and parents , because he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood . And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor , it does not only affect the life of a girl , it also affects the life of the male members of the family . She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed .
And it is also interesting that this so-called code of honor , it does not only affect the life of a girl , it also affects the life of the male members of the family . She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them . Otherwise , she will be called disobedient .
The role model good girl should be very quiet . She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders , even if she does not like them . She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family , and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor , she could even be killed .

A good girl is supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very submissive . Otherwise , she will be called disobedient . And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience .
The role model good girl should be very quiet . A good girl is supposed to be very quiet , very humble and very submissive .
And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience . The role model good girl should be very quiet . Ladies and gentlemen , this plight of millions of women could be changed if we think differently , if women and men think differently , if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries , if they can break a few norms of family and society , if they can abolish the discriminatory laws of the systems in their states , which go against the basic human rights of the women .

And this vicious cycle goes on , goes on . And what happens at the end ?



But when I looked , all were men , and I picked my pen , drew a line from my name , and wrote , &quot; Malala . &quot; Dear brothers and sisters , when Malala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like newborn children , to be honest , but when I went and I looked into her eyes , believe me , I got extremely honored .


A few days after Malala was born , my daughter was born , my cousin came -- and it was a coincidence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Yousafzai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors . And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan . Enrollment in a school means recognition of her identity and her name .

Yes , I must mention it . Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life . It may be taken for granted in Canada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patriarchal societies , in tribal societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl .
You will be asking , then , why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school ?

I have five sisters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be astonished , two weeks before , when I was filling out the Canadian visa form , and I was filling out the family part of the form , I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters .
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings .
I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well . I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter .

And all these good values , I tried to inculcate in her personality .
I imparted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well . I taught my girls , I taught my girl students , to unlearn the lesson of obedience . I taught my boy students to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor .

It was called Talibanization . Dear brothers and sisters , we were striving for more rights for women , and we were struggling to have more , more and more space for the women in society . It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women &apos;s rights .


Millions were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights . At the age of 10 , Malala stood , and she stood for the right of education . It was called Talibanization .
At the age of 10 , Malala stood , and she stood for the right of education . She wrote a diary for the BBC blog , she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries , and she spoke from every platform she could . It &apos;s really the most scary thing .
Millions were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights . Hundreds of schools were lost .
Millions were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights . And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign , and on October 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point blank range .
Millions were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scary thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flog , and you speak for your rights . At the age of 10 , Malala stood , and she stood for the right of education . And her voice was the most powerful voice .

While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whispered into the ears of my wife , &quot; Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot;
You put your life at stake for the cause of truth , for the cause of peace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you . While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whispered into the ears of my wife , &quot; Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign , and on October 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point blank range .

While my daughter was on the verge of life and death , I whispered into the ears of my wife , &quot; Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot; And she abruptly told me , &quot; Please don &apos;t blame yourself . But my daughter never complained .

She used to tell us , &quot; I &apos;m fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face .
When Malala was in the hospital , and she was going through the severe pains and she had had severe headaches because her facial nerve was cut down , I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife . But my daughter never complained . Dear brothers and sisters , we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16-year old girl .



But my daughter never complained . She quarrels with her brothers , and I am very happy for that . Dear brothers and sisters , we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16-year old girl .
People ask me , what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised ?





And everyone in this room has to get into it .

Let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine .

I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or &quot; American Idol . &quot; And you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
And I understand that . I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking . A big machine , a cool , TED-ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .


I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or &quot; American Idol . &quot; And I wonder what you &apos;d choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back . And you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .

It &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .

It &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
My great-grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 . It &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward . I &apos;m not part of that crowd , I have to say .




There &apos;s never been a time like this .


My grandparents pushed that number to 70 . A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago . My parents are closing in on 80 .
Think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact . A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago . In the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .



It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has . In the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly . Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .



And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day . And to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .


And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .


Potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too . And one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day . Unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe . But here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : We &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . Never . I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .






And , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress .


But here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : We &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . Never . We &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the Enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now . People wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
And , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress . You &apos;re not entitled to your own facts . Sorry , you &apos;re not . Not even the truth will set them free .
But you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ? And , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress .

Same thing , only bigger . I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on . People were going crazy .
So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground . About a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . A little story .


About a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . A little story .

And soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on . So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground . And soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .




We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to . They were exactly like the people in this room . But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
And that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fanatics at all .


We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : &quot; progress . &quot;

We &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have . Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , hanging chads . We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .

We talk about it ambivalently . But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
We talk about it ambivalently . Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .

Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , hanging chads . Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are . And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
Ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence . You know , you can choose your list . You can just say a few names and people will understand .





The data came back . Tons of studies were done to see if this was true . It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .

About 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .

The data came back .

It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real . Tons of studies were done to see if this was true . The data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .




Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ? Because , did anyone have measles here ? Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did anyone have measles here ? Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ? But you know what ?
Disastrous because here &apos;s a fact : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down . The result of that has been disastrous .
Doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year . That is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves . What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?

Doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year . Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ? That &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .


Doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year . Because , did anyone have measles here ?
Doesn &apos;t happen very much .
No fear , no agony . Polio -- puff , gone . He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us . And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .



He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people . He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us . This guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .


And he actually says it that way . Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining . His name is Paul Offit .

Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .

Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining . His name is Paul Offit . So , Paul &apos;s a terrorist .

And why ? Because Paul made a vaccine . I don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential . We have measles in this country now .


We have measles in this country now .












Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to LAX , right now he &apos;s over Ohio .




And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight . They take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless . And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
Everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
Echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going . They darken your urine . They almost never do more than that . I know you did because half of Americans do every day .

Everyone take their vitamins this morning ? Echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going . I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
Dark urine . Dark . They darken your urine . They almost never do more than that .
And we shouldn &apos;t : Our health care system sucks . Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ? We hate Big Government . We don &apos;t trust the Man .
Well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma . We hate Big Government . We don &apos;t trust the Man . Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?

We hate Big Government . We don &apos;t trust the Man . It &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ? It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .

That &apos;s fantastic . I love Big Placebo . We hate Big Government . We don &apos;t trust the Man . I &apos;m totally with you .
It &apos;s absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it . Well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma . Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
And we shouldn &apos;t : Our health care system sucks . It &apos;s cruel to millions of people . But , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
It &apos;s absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it . Well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma . We leap into the arms of Big Placebo .

None of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
None of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
So we run away from it , and where do we run ? It makes them feel good . &quot;






Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease . When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be . There are . There always are .




Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .



Now , the most mindless epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite . We got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t . And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .








We don &apos;t want companies owning seeds . You don &apos;t want to do that ? We don &apos;t companies patenting life .

We don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .




Well , the things I constantly hear are : Too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .












We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance . It &apos;s kind of like a potato . It doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .


And why ? Genetically engineered food .
It &apos;s kind of like a potato . It doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now . Cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind . That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse , but it would be nice . Cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .

I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fighting it ?
And all I can say about this is : Why are we fighting it ? It doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .


This isn &apos;t about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant . It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
So after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot;



It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food . This isn &apos;t about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant . So after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
We have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
We have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do . It &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity . We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beneath us , and we really have to stop it . If we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re guilty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of : high-tech colonialism . We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .



It &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity . We can set that time machine on anything we want .


So that said , there &apos;s a stigma when you have brain surgery .

And if not , can you make yourself smart again ? So that said , there &apos;s a stigma when you have brain surgery . I had brain surgery 18 years ago , and since that time , brain science has become a personal passion of mine .
Are you still smart or not ? I &apos;m actually an engineer . One particularly dramatic case : for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s , and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed .


I began to try different mixtures , and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self , my sense of who I was , my thinking , my behavior towards people . I was kind of extreme . One particularly dramatic case : for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s , and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed .

What I was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery , my creative thought , my idea flow . Immediately after my surgery , I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day , because if I just took nothing , I would die within hours . I began to try different mixtures , and I was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self , my sense of who I was , my thinking , my behavior towards people .
Immediately after my surgery , I had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day , because if I just took nothing , I would die within hours .

I was actually trying , with a little bit of insecurity , to actually fix a problem in front of me , and it just didn &apos;t come out that way . This kind of thinking isn &apos;t new . There have been several close calls .
One particularly dramatic case : for a couple months I actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s , and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed . But luckily , I &apos;m an experimentalist at heart , so I decided I would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn &apos;t a clear road map on this that &apos;s detailed . And I think mostly in images , and so for me that became a key metric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping , if you will , my ideas , trying on different new ideas for size , playing out scenarios .

There are those today that dispute that , and lots of debates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : Mental images , for most of us , are central in inventive and creative thinking . And I think mostly in images , and so for me that became a key metric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rapid prototyping , if you will , my ideas , trying on different new ideas for size , playing out scenarios .

There are those today that dispute that , and lots of debates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : Mental images , for most of us , are central in inventive and creative thinking .

There are those today that dispute that , and lots of debates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : Mental images , for most of us , are central in inventive and creative thinking .
So let me show you why I think we &apos;re pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuroscience groups . There are those today that dispute that , and lots of debates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : Mental images , for most of us , are central in inventive and creative thinking .

Can you imagine , if you will , a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her ? Or a musician to get the music out of his head ?



The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is next to nothing . And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image . And the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column , showing the difference to be nearly zero .
The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining , seeing that same image . Both used fMRI technology -- functional magnetic resonance imaging technology -- to image the brain , and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis and his colleagues at Harvard .

The middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining , seeing that same image . And the left-hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image . The computer , using brain scan data alone , decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing .


This was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images , always with a similar result . The computer , using brain scan data alone , decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing .
Then a new movie was shown with new images , new people , new animals in it , and a new scan set was recorded .
In this experiment , individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences .



The computer , using brain scan data alone , decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing .
Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse . I &apos;m not for that . And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image , it creates the same brain scan .





Next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse .
I &apos;m putting forward an idea : instead of bigger magnets , let &apos;s make better magnets .



But yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers in the MRI systems . Conventional wisdom says the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets , but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements , not the thousandfold we need .
A lot of effort in MRI over the years has gone into making really big , really huge magnets , right ? And using fMRI , we should be able to measure not just oxygenated blood flow , but the hormones and neurotransmitters I &apos;ve talked about and maybe even the direct neural activity , which is the dream .

Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought ? And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought ?
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought ?

Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought ?

What would we be capable of then ? Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought ? It &apos;s hard to imagine it taking much longer .
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought ? We have little option but to open this door . And indeed , this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer &apos;s and similar diseases .






All a closet is is a hard conversation , and although our topics may vary tremendously , the experience of being in and coming out of the closet is universal . It is scary , and we hate it , and it needs to be done .
Your closet may be telling someone you love her for the first time , or telling someone that you &apos;re pregnant , or telling someone you have cancer , or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives .






Several years ago , I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe , a local diner in town , and during my time there I would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity : not shaving my armpits , quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel . So I promised myself , the next time , I would say something . And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head , the question would often be sprung on me , usually by a little kid : &quot; Um , are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
But I would say nothing , and I would seethe inside . And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts and how recently I had shaved my head , the question would often be sprung on me , usually by a little kid : &quot; Um , are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot; &quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;




I &apos;ve got my Gloria Steinem quotes . Well , I &apos;m more of a comfy jammies kind of girl . &quot;
I &apos;ve got my Gloria Steinem quotes . I &apos;ve even got this little bit from &quot; Vagina Monologues &quot; I &apos;m going to do . So I take another deep breath , squat down to next to her , and say , &quot; Hey , I know it &apos;s kind of confusing .
&quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress , not a challenge to a feminist duel , just a kid with a question : &quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;

So I take a deep breath and I look down and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress , not a challenge to a feminist duel , just a kid with a question : &quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot; My hair is short like a boy &apos;s , and I wear boy &apos;s clothes , but I &apos;m a girl , and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress , and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies ? So like many of us , I &apos;ve lived in a few closets in my life , and yeah , most often , my walls happened to be rainbow .



It was the easiest hard conversation I have ever had . You just know what it feels like to live in a closet .

You just know what it feels like to live in a closet . Hard is hard . Sure , I &apos;ll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours , but here &apos;s the thing : Hard is not relative .
But inside , in the dark , you can &apos;t tell what color the walls are .
So like many of us , I &apos;ve lived in a few closets in my life , and yeah , most often , my walls happened to be rainbow .
We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else &apos;s hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard . There is no harder , there is just hard .

Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five-year-old you &apos;re getting a divorce ? Sure , I &apos;ll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours , but here &apos;s the thing : Hard is not relative . There is no harder , there is just hard .
Who can tell me that explaining to someone you &apos;ve just declared bankruptcy is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them ? Sure , I &apos;ll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours , but here &apos;s the thing : Hard is not relative . There is no harder , there is just hard .

I was frozen by fear , curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade , and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done . I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long , but if you do not throw that grenade , it will kill you .
I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe . I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long , but if you do not throw that grenade , it will kill you . One of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister &apos;s wedding .

My family , my friends , complete strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people , and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose .

&quot; Well , we &apos;ve never been there but we &apos;ve heard it &apos;s fabulous . &quot; And the battle of gay relatability had begun . My family , my friends , complete strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people , and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose .
I was frozen by fear , curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade , and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done . And after a little small talk , one of the women shouted out , &quot; I love Nathan Lane ! &quot; He &apos;s really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend . &quot;

&quot; Well , we &apos;ve never been there but we &apos;ve heard it &apos;s fabulous . &quot;
And after a little small talk , one of the women shouted out , &quot; I love Nathan Lane ! &quot; Our favorite TV show ? Favorite : Will &amp; amp ; Grace .





&quot; Ash , what &apos;s your favorite TV show ? Our favorite TV show ? Favorite : Will &amp; amp ; Grace . &quot; Ash , do you know my hairdresser Antonio ?
I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table and mock their responses , chastise their unworldliness and their inability to jump through the politically correct gay hoops I had brought with me , or I could empathize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done , that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their closets .

Sure , it would have been easy to point out where they felt short . And what else can you ask someone to do but try ? But I &apos;m getting better , and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles .

Number one : Be authentic .

But I &apos;m getting better , and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles .
Number one : Be authentic . And what else can you ask someone to do but try ? Take the armor off . Be yourself .

Ask anybody I have ever dated .
If you &apos;re going to be real with someone , you gotta be ready for real in return . Number two : Be direct . Just say it . Rip the Band-Aid off . But I &apos;m getting better , and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles .


Now , please view this through gay-colored lenses , but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same . Number one : Be authentic . That kid in the cafe had no armor , but I was ready for battle .
Number one : Be authentic . You are speaking your truth . Do not give them that sense of false hope .
If you tell your parents you might be gay , they will hold out hope that this will change .



And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way , so sure , apologize for what you &apos;ve done , but never apologize for who you are . Do not give them that sense of false hope . Those are their expectations of who you are , not yours .
If you know you are gay , just say it .
Do not give them that sense of false hope .





So the next time you find yourself in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade , know we have all been there before .


And so , several years ago , I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence .
And so , several years ago , I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence .
However , if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that &#91; fly &#93; , you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines . You observe that , over the course of the millennia , Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point , and that at some point , corresponding roughly to our year , 2000 AD , asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth . Pretend that you &apos;re an alien race that doesn &apos;t know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence , but you have amazing telescopes and you &apos;re able to watch the Earth , and you have amazingly long lives , so you &apos;re able to watch the Earth over millions , even billions of years .



But if you &apos;re an alien race who doesn &apos;t know any of this , doesn &apos;t have any concept of Earth intelligence , you &apos;d be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how , up until a certain point in time , asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that . Let &apos;s first begin with a thought experiment . You observe that , over the course of the millennia , Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point , and that at some point , corresponding roughly to our year , 2000 AD , asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth .

Now of course , as earthlings , we know the reason would be that we &apos;re trying to save ourselves .
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence . So in this program that I undertook several years ago , I looked at a variety of different threads across science , across a variety of disciplines , that were pointing , I think , towards a single , underlying mechanism for intelligence . And the answer , I believe , is yes . &#91; &quot; F = T ∇ Sτ &quot; &#93; What you &apos;re seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc ² for intelligence that I &apos;ve seen .

And so , taking all of these different threads and putting them together , I asked , starting several years ago , is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads ?
It acts to maximize future freedom of action , or keep options open , with some strength T , with the diversity of possible accessible futures , S , up to some future time horizon , tau . So in this program that I undertook several years ago , I looked at a variety of different threads across science , across a variety of disciplines , that were pointing , I think , towards a single , underlying mechanism for intelligence . And the answer , I believe , is yes . &#91; &quot; F = T ∇ Sτ &quot; &#93; What you &apos;re seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc ² for intelligence that I &apos;ve seen .

So what you &apos;re seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force , F , that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action .
It acts to maximize future freedom of action , or keep options open , with some strength T , with the diversity of possible accessible futures , S , up to some future time horizon , tau .

Does it predict human-level intelligence ? Does it predict artificial intelligence ? What if intelligent behavior doesn &apos;t just correlate with the production of long-term entropy , but actually emerges directly from it ?
Does it predict artificial intelligence ? How predictive is it ? But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship ?
Does it predict human-level intelligence ? How predictive is it ? So I &apos;m going to show you now a video that will , I think , demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation .
Amazingly , Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests , play human games , and even earn money trading stocks , all without being instructed to do so . And so , given this one equation , it &apos;s natural to ask , so what can you do with this ? But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship ?

This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture . It simply decided on its own to balance the pole . This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies .
Amazingly , Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests , play human games , and even earn money trading stocks , all without being instructed to do so . Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces , here we see that Entropica , again on its own initiative , was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk , representing a tool , to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position . It simply decided on its own to balance the pole .
This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies . This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal . Just like a human standing upright without falling over , here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart .
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture . Amazingly , Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests , play human games , and even earn money trading stocks , all without being instructed to do so . In addition , just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food , here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task .


This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
In addition , just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food , here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task . For example , here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself , illustrating its potential for gaming . Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected .
By the same token , Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense , logistics and transportation . This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture . This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care , energy , and intelligence .

Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships , successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific .

Alex Wissner-Gross : So what you &apos;ve just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation , which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action .

My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence , is the following : Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future .
I &apos;m often asked , how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework ? My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence , is the following : Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future . Finally , Richard Feynman , famous physicist , once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization , that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they &apos;re far apart but repel each other when they &apos;re close together .
Another important consequence is goal seeking . Finally , Richard Feynman , famous physicist , once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization , that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they &apos;re far apart but repel each other when they &apos;re close together . One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades , we &apos;ve had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse .
